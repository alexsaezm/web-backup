  <p>Hi there! I&rsquo;m Álex, a fully remote software engineer at <a href="https://redhat.com">Red
Hat</a>. Welcome to my small corner on the Interwebs.</p>
<p>Being a remote worker allows me to live in my
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asturias">homeland</a> with my lovely girlfriend,
near my parents and friends. It&rsquo;s something quite important to me.</p>
<p>I mainly work on the <a href="https://golang.org">Go toolchain</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/go-delve/delve">Delve</a>, the standard de facto debugger for
Go applications. That also involves working on
<a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux">RHEL</a>,
maintaining the <a href="https://github.com/golang-fips/go">FIPS-enabled Go toolchain</a>.
I&rsquo;m also a proud <a href="https://getfedora.org">Fedora</a> contributor, where I help keep
the Go ecosystem healthy.</p>
<p>Most of my public contributions are on <a href="https://github.com/alexsaezm">GitHub</a>,
<a href="https://gitlab.com/alexsaezm">GitLab</a>, and
<a href="https://src.fedoraproject.org/user/alexsaezm">Fedora</a>.</p>
<p>Before joining Red Hat in 2019, I worked as a DevOps Engineer and System
Administrator at several companies. You can find <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/alexsaezm">that information on my
LinkedIn page</a>, but keep in mind that I only
add people I know. I don&rsquo;t know who else does this, but I don&rsquo;t add exciting
profiles that might be useful in the future, nor recruiters. Just real people I
met somehow. If you know me and use LinkedIn, feel free to reach me there.</p>
<p>Outside work, I usually read novels, play video games, run when I&rsquo;m not
injured, and drink coffee. Wait. I also drink coffee while I work. Well, never
mind.</p>
<p>If you want to say hi, do it in the fediverse at @alex@alexsaezm.com. Sounds cool, uh?</p>
<p>You might find me on other platforms like Twitter or Instagram (who knows where
else I created an account). Still, <a href="/2022/10/30/freed.html">I&rsquo;m avoiding social networks as much as
possible</a>, so I won&rsquo;t see your messages. Please don&rsquo;t get mad at me.</p>
