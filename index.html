<p>I am disappointed. An extremely good book with an extremely bad ending. The last few chapters feel like the author didn‚Äôt want to continue the story and rushed to close it.</p>
<p>Few other things make the book odd. Most of the characters are not relevant. The author creates them, makes them interesting and then, they disappear forever without any significant effect on the protagonist. Others are extremely relevant but they appear so late in the novel that you cannot feel interest at all. And the whole genetic thing is just superfluous.</p>

			 <p>Fedora 38 will have Go 1.21 until its EOL (2024-05-14). FESCo approved the change, and it was <a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4FNTZO3WT4OTGEBNEUSLUJ4TUYKU6KLJ/">announced few days ago</a>. <a href="https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2024-b59bfba5a5">The update is on testing</a> and unless something happens it will be push soon. Feel free to test it and give karma if everything works for you.</p>
<p>By the way, this doesn&rsquo;t mean there will be a mass rebuild of everything in Fedora 38 to use Go 1.21. Only new updates will use it.
This is the third time we do this kind of update to avoid having an unsupported version in Fedora for weeks.</p>
<p>And, just a reminder that if you want the latest Go releases, you can always enable the <a href="https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/g/go-sig/golang-rawhide/">golang-rawhide COPR project</a> that I maintain.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780679740674">The Man in the High Castle</a> by Philip K. Dick üìö</p>
<p>I enjoyed it and at the same time, found it not engaging at all. The amount of work the author put into writing fake but plausible historical events where a small deviation from real history changes everything is amazing. That&rsquo;s a problem also because to appreciate the book you need to know a lot about relevant WWII figures. Somebody didn&rsquo;t die, someone else didn&rsquo;t get re-elected, etc.</p>
<p>The biggest problem is the characters. Their stories are just not interesting. Some of them are even infuriating. Juliana is extremely chaotic and don&rsquo;t get me started with Frank.</p>
<p>People usually complain about the ending but I quite enjoyed it. My only problem is the characters and their stories. The rest? Great.</p>
<p>If you are going to read it because of the TV show, don&rsquo;t. It has very little to do with it.</p>

			 <p>I don‚Äôt understand cups, but I have a set of them. The recipe says 100ml of olive oil, so I asked for help:</p>
<p><strong>Conversion Challenge: Cups to Milliliters</strong></p>
<p><em>Analysis:</em>
To convert cups to milliliters, we need to understand the volume each cup represents.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>1 Cup:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Volume: 236.588 ml</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>1/2 Cup:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Volume: 118.294 ml</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>1/3 Cup:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Volume: 78.729 ml</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>1/4 Cup:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Volume: 59.147 ml</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>1/8 Cup:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Volume: 29.574 ml</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Calculation:</em>
To obtain 100 ml using the available cups, we can explore various combinations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using 1 Cup: 236.588 ml (exceeds 100 ml)</li>
<li>Combining 1/2 Cup twice: 118.294 ml + 118.294 ml = 236.588 ml (exceeds 100 ml)</li>
<li>Combining 1/2 Cup and 1/4 Cup: 118.294 ml + 59.147 ml = 177.441 ml (insufficient)</li>
<li>Combining 1/3 Cup and 1/4 Cup: 78.729 ml + 59.147 ml = 137.876 ml (insufficient)</li>
<li>Combining 1/3 Cup and 1/8 Cup three times: 78.729 ml + 3 * 29.574 ml = 167.457 ml (insufficient)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Recommended Combination:</em>
The most suitable combination is using 1/2 Cup twice:</p>
<ul>
<li>118.294 ml + 118.294 ml = 236.588 ml</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Conclusion:</em>
To achieve 100 ml, you can use two 1/2 cups.</p>

<p>I find this section of the Indie Microblogging book quite interesting. I never stopped to think about the linkblogging format.</p>
<p>Sometimes pages link to an Instagram or a Twitter post and make news from it. And I find that lazy. Because most of them are drama posts or ‚Äúlook what this account did‚Äù style of posts.</p>
<p>But the examples linked are quite good and the technical limitations interesting for someone like me that has very little knowledge about ‚Äúthe web‚Äù.</p>
<p>P.S: Isn‚Äôt it quite meta to talk about link blogging while doing linkblogging?</p>

<p>I cannot be optimistic about this in any way.</p>
<p>Thunderbird (product that I use daily) is of course not very relevant nowadays. But Firefox? Yeah, small market, but the long standing alternative to business controlled web browsers shouldn‚Äôt go away. Should be main priority.</p>
<p>I want to believe they‚Äôll keep it up and running. But I cannot blame them. Nobody cares about web browsers any more.</p>

I like to use pull request for all my changes, (we are a lot of people making Fedora possible and it brings clarity in the intentions), but for yet-to-be-accepted changes is mandatory, Rawhide won&rsquo;t have Go 1.22 until is approved by FESCo.</p>
<p>On a side note, <a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/ZQROWTMARIUS45KIQZIUNAA45K3NWLRW/">there is an ongoing conversation about some defaults we ship in Fedora</a>.

<p>I don&rsquo;t do this anymore, as I explain a little down.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I use <a href="https://containertoolbx.org/">Toolbox</a> a lot, like every single day. And I have a very minimal bash prompt (just <code>$ </code> in green and <code>&gt; </code> in red for PS2). But it is quite hard to tell at a glance if I am inside a Podman container that was created by Toolbox, mostly because the tools I normally use, are there, and it&rsquo;s my home directory.</p>
<p>I usually check /etc/fedora-release but that&rsquo;s a poor check.</p>
<p>Well, now my prompt inside a container is different:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#75715e"># Colors</span>

</code></pre></div><p>That&rsquo;s good enough for now.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>What I do now:</strong></p>
<p>Since I made this post, I realized there were some issues with the coloring in the prompt. Instead of debugging it, I changed a few things.</p>
<p>For starters, I keep my prompt the same everywhere and use the hostname as a way to identify where I am. So one line instead of the whole chunk before:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">export PS1<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;\[\e[38;5;202m\]\h \[\e[38;5;131m\]\$ \[\033[0m\]&#34;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>It is not as minimal as before, but quite there.</p>
<p>I also use fzf keybindings which are usually not present inside a container. Instead of using the <code>grep -q container /proc/self/cgroup</code> approach, I just check if they are present or not:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#75715e"># FZF: dnf install fzf -y</span>
<span style="color:#75715e"># Source only fzf bindings if the file exists. A common scenario is inside a container.</span>
FZF_BINDINGS<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;/usr/share/fzf/shell/key-bindings.bash&#34;</span>
<span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> <span style="color:#f92672">[</span> -f $FZF_BINDINGS <span style="color:#f92672">]</span>; <span style="color:#66d9ef">then</span>
	source $FZF_BINDINGS
<span style="color:#66d9ef">fi</span>
</code></pre></div><p>So I guess the conclusion here is&hellip; simplifying is always better?</p>
<p>In any case, the original idea of detecting if you are inside a container still works:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> grep -q container /proc/self/cgroup; <span style="color:#66d9ef">then</span>
	echo <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Inside a container&#34;</span>
<span style="color:#66d9ef">else</span>
	echo <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Outside a container&#34;</span>
<span style="color:#66d9ef">fi</span>
</code></pre></div><p><strong>Now</strong> is good enough.</p>

			 <p>TL;DR: Delve now has bundle dependencies.</p>
<p>While working on integrating Delve with Packit, I found myself trying to fix some dependencies again. This is not usually a problem, but in some packages, like Delve, the version of the already existing Fedora packages containing the dependencies doesn&rsquo;t match. Patching tests to adapt them to a different version when the upstream project is active and well-tested sounds like a bad idea. So, I bundled the dependencies.</p>
<p>This should make the whole update process for Delve really straightforward and almost automagic because Packit will detect new versions and open the PR for every supported branch.</p>
<p>By the way, I created a <a href="https://alexsaezm.com/categories/fedora">Fedora category</a> and added myself to <a href="http://fedoraplanet.org">Fedora Planet</a>.</p>

			 <p>I think I migrated my Mastodon account to my page (on purpose).</p>
<p>The why? Not sure. I&rsquo;m not too fond of cross-posting for some reason, and I am not using successfully social networks. Honestly, Mastodon never hooked me like Twitter did. Which is fine; I was addicted to Twitter. But having a Mastodon account feels a little bit like FOMO.</p>
<p>I guess this migration is a way not to feel 100% isolated from the world. But somehow still be. Be mindfully isolated if that makes sense.</p>
<p>If I understood the documentation correctly, I won&rsquo;t have boosts, for example, but replies should be integrated. That&rsquo;s good enough for me.</p>
<p>Edit: oh btw, I imported all the contacts I was following&hellip; but I saw several errors in the logs. In any case, I was almost a ghost in Mastodon so I don&rsquo;t expect much changes.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m wondering if I should start writing small posts instead of the weekly notes (I have been busy and didn&rsquo;t feel like I wanted to write them). Instead of finding the time for a short post about relevant stuff that happened that week, and more often than not, nothing happened, what about writing a small post?</p>
<p>Yes, I am thinking about using micro.blog as it was designed for.</p>
<p>I recently listened to a talk about tech blogs in WordPress, and the speaker emphasized that long posts are generally more challenging to write and less likely to be helpful.</p>
<p>So, I guess I&rsquo;ll give it a try soon.</p>

			 <p>This past week has been slow. Half of it was me reading emails after a week of traveling (sometimes I wonder why we take time off), and the other half was COVID recovery.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s jump into what was noteworthy.</p>
<h2 id="fedora">Fedora</h2>
<p>Several updates in Go.
<a href="https://fedorapeople.org/groups/schedule/f-39/f-39-key-tasks.html">Fedora 37 is almost EOL (Tue 2023-11-28)</a>, and as I did for Fedora 36, <a href="https://pagure.io/fesco/issue/3077">I requested FESCo to get approval to bump up from 1.19 to 1.20</a>. So now Fedora 37 and Fedora 38 both have the same Go release.
Also, if you are unaware of this, <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/63427">a lovely critical CVE was fixed in Go 1.21.3</a>. Fedora 39 and Rawhide should have this version
You can check the release updates here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2023-4bf641255e">Fedora 37</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2023-fe53e13b5b">Fedora 38</a></li>

<li><a href="https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2023-d4a817543f">Fedora 40</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-stuff">Other stuff</h2>
<p>Continue reading Dune and listening to The Hobbit while I do chores. I did enjoy The Hobbit back in the day, but I am enjoying the audio version even more. Dune, well, it is getting better (I am almost done with it), but nope, sorry, I think it is an excellent plot with awful writing.</p>
<p>I thought I had recovered from COVID, but I had a 10k race this Sunday and felt it. I do not compete at all; I run for fun, and I think I did it quite nicely. My comparison is always my previous races, and in this case, I did it great. But&hellip; I felt the COVID effects and the lack of training over the last two weeks. That was not fun.</p>
<h2 id="next-week">Next week</h2>
<p>I want to work on a POC to improve the workflow and coverage in the Go FIPS fork and, at the same time, write a blog post about it (which is a critical task I need to finish before next week) so&hellip; that will be my main focus.
If I have time for whatever reason (I don&rsquo;t think so), I&rsquo;ll start a small pet project I am excited about.</p>

			 <p>This was a weird week. I planed to write a daily note of my trip to Munich but I got COVID.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="saturday">Saturday</h2>
<p>Traveling from Asturias to Munich is quite easy. Nowadays there&rsquo;s a direct flight to Munich. In less than 3 hours you are already there. Getting out of the Airport in Munich by train is also an easy thing.
We arrived late and it was already really dark so we went directly to the hotel room.</p>
<h2 id="sunday">Sunday</h2>
<p>We had the whole day to explore the city. I already visited Munich years ago when I joined Red Hat in 2019 but I didn&rsquo;t have enough time to visit it properly.</p>
<p>But, first things first, coffee. I usually check <a href="https://europeancoffeetrip.com/">European Coffee Trip</a> to find nice places when I visit a new city. So our first stop was <a href="https://www.bean-batter.de/">Bean Batter</a>. After a nice cup of coffee and a waffle, we visited Marienplatz.</p>
<h2 id="monday">Monday</h2>
<p>Monday was a busy day. I had my first night of fever, so armed with ibuprofen, we visited Dachau in the morning and a tour of the city in the evening. The experience is not easy, and the fever didn&rsquo;t help. Somehow (given the context) I enjoyed the tour and I encourage anyone to visit the place.</p>
<h2 id="tuesday--wednesday">Tuesday &amp; Wednesday</h2>
<p>Time for keep visiting the city. No tours. And oh boy I was happy. Fever sky rocketed these days. We visited the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Englischer_Garten">Englischer Garten</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nymphenburg_Palace">Nymphenburg Palace</a>.</p>
<h2 id="thursday">Thursday</h2>
<p>We visited <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuschwanstein_Castle">Neuschwanstein Castle</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linderhof_Palace">Linderhof Palace</a>. While I still had fever, the visit worth the effort totally.</p>
<h2 id="friday">Friday</h2>
<p>Last day. Free time to visit a little more the city</p>
<h2 id="saturday-1">Saturday</h2>
<p>Back. Nothing much to say apart that I checked if I had COVID and yes. Bingo! First time I catch this.</p>
<h2 id="next-week">Next week</h2>
<p>Catch up with emails and try to recover. We&rsquo;ll see what else happens.</p>

			 <p>Short notes this time, but it is better short than nothing.</p>
<h2 id="go-fips">Go FIPS</h2>
<p>I continued working on benchmarking the CGO calls, but suddenly, something shiner popped out that grabbed my attention. When we migrated the Go FIPS fork from Pagure to GitHub, we changed the way it was developed, and we added a CI to check the PRs. But there was a minor limitation: we don‚Äôt test it against all of the architectures that we use in RHEL. That wasn‚Äôt a problem because we do the tests when we cut a release. But this week, I invested a significant amount of time in changing this. I already have a POC, and I‚Äôll write more about how we‚Äôll do it once it‚Äôs deployed.</p>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>I‚Äôm still reading Dune and listening to The Hobbit. I read it as a kid, but I find the Spanish audio version enjoyable for my long runs.</p>
<h2 id="next-week">Next week</h2>
<p>I‚Äôll be in Munich, visiting the city (I‚Äôm already writing this from the hotel room). The weeknotes will be slightly different, and I‚Äôll try to add pictures.</p>

			 <p>After several months without writing, I&rsquo;m here again.</p>
<p>As I clearly don&rsquo;t remember everything I did these past months, let me go through the most relevant things and then jump into the week.</p>
<h2 id="long-time">Long time!</h2>
<p>The last time I wrote was the&ndash;checks his notes&ndash; April 24th. Wow, 178 days ago. Let&rsquo;s review some stats first, shall we?</p>

</ul>
<p>Not bad, not bad. It could be better, but not bad (I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m not tracking everything).</p>
<p>So I had a pretty robust set of months; I even got recognition at work (I&rsquo;m not going to enter into details because of private stuff. But it was an unexpected nice thing). It was part of a series of changes I made in my workflow and events that culminated simultaneously. I&rsquo;ll talk about the changes in my workflow in another post.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fedora: Due to several events, I adopted many packages in Fedora. Currently, I own almost 300 packages. I keep maintaining Go and Delve primarily, but now I also carry several other small Go packages.</li>
<li>Delve: <a href="https://github.com/go-delve/delve/pull/2963">My port to PPC64LE was merged</a>!</li>
<li>Health: My health went down slightly as my back started to hurt badly. I resumed my training recently and began doing pilates, so I&rsquo;m back on track, and my back doesn&rsquo;t hurt anymore. But I was slightly scared of how quickly my health went down the hill. I race a 10k in 3 weeks, so I guess it means I&rsquo;m okay again.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, onto the current week</p>
<h2 id="this-week">This week</h2>
<ul>
<li>I migrated to Micro.blog, as I <a href="https://alexsaezm.com/2023/09/26/quick-minor-update.html">explained here</a>. I had yet to learn they support Hugo blogs, and they solved one of my main issues with the blog: writing on the go. It was a no-brainer. It could be better, but I love its indie aspect.</li>
<li>SPDX licensing. There&rsquo;s an ongoing effort to change the naming of the licenses in Fedora ELN. Go and Delve are set. <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/legal/update-existing-packages/">Documentation</a>.</li>
<li>CGO calls: I&rsquo;m starting a project where I need to evaluate the performance of the CGO calls in the Go FIPS fork. This is an entirely new field for me. I had very little time due to internal tasks this week, but at least I have the current benchmarks of some of the cryptographic algorithms. If this ends well, I smell a cool blog post.</li>
<li>Go SIG: The bridge between Matrix and the IRC (where the bot for the meetings runs) has been down for a few weeks now, so the meetings have been slightly dry recently. But in general, the community is healthier than ever.</li>
<li>Training: I&rsquo;m a little under the weather (if it&rsquo;s not flu, I don&rsquo;t know what it is), so I didn&rsquo;t run, but I attended my two pilates classes. I hope to squeeze in a short run this weekend.</li>
<li>Books: This week has been Dune all the time. I know some people will hate me, but&hellip; I do not like the book at all. The writing is horrible. I hope it gets better.</li>
</ul>
<p>I know this was a chaotic weeknotes post but way better to deliver than keep it laying around, am I right?</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>These last months, I&rsquo;ve been disconnected from the world on purpose‚Äîmore than usual. I&rsquo;ll share the updates in the next weeknotes post.</p>
<p>The last content update was in April. Two or three weeks ago, I changed the theme to something made by someone else who knows way more than me.
Now, I have migrated from the classic static website system to Micro.blog. That means very little for the visits because it&rsquo;s the same Hugo theme and the same content (well, maybe I broke a few links in the migration), but for me, it&rsquo;s a game-changer. Or that is what I want to believe now that I pay for it.</p>
<p>The platform feels old school, indie if you like. And that&rsquo;s something I really cherish in this day and age of super cool, flashy, overdesigned websites. It&rsquo;s not perfect (I had several issues understanding the themes and the features the service has), but the creator feels like a normal, reachable guy. I like that.
It uses Hugo (something I didn&rsquo;t know when I found the platform years ago), which lets me quickly publish from my phone. And it has &ldquo;fediverse&rdquo; capabilities like web mentions and ActivityPub. And it has cross-posting without me using IFTTT-like services.</p>
<p>In general, it feels like a good web citizen.</p>
<p>So I guess/hope I&rsquo;ll write more. Because where is the point of having a blog if you don&rsquo;t use it?</p>

			 <p>It was a pleasant, productive week. One of those weeks where nothing closed up,
but you touched several things that, at least for a little, moved the needle
forward in multiple areas.</p>
<h2 id="fedora">Fedora</h2>
<p>The Delve maintainers published a new update a few weeks ago, and now Fedora
has it. Also, I reviewed two new package requests and worked on merging the
RHEL spec file into the Fedora one. The whole idea of this merge is to make ELN
builds easy and potentially facilitate the future support of FIPS in Fedora,
which means going through the entire spec file and refactoring some parts. It&rsquo;s
not hard per se, but there are many changes and some of the stuff there needs
to be updated.</p>
<h2 id="upstream">Upstream</h2>
<p>I mainly worked on the Delve port. I started with the configuration of the
server for the CI and also worked on fixing a huge mess I had with a rebase.
<code>git checkout -p</code> was a necessary but crazy need.</p>
<h2 id="other">Other</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Mark this point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This task is so challenging that it should be a disclaimer at the beginning of
the page. A few weeks ago, I bought an ergonomic keyboard, the ZSA Moonlander.
I have been interested in a Kinesis keyboard for years, but the price is
insulting. It&rsquo;s around 800 euros after modifications and taxes. The design is
superior to any other ergonomic keyboard (never say never). Instead of risking
that amount of money, I spent 400 euros (wouldn&rsquo;t it be funny not to like it
and buy the 800 one?) on the Moonlander. And I have strong mixed feelings. The
technical features are impressive. I love that the layout is programmed into
the keyboard, which allows you to plug it in and use it without configuring
anything in the OS. But, and there is always a but, QWERTY in this keyboard is
a nightmare. I never considered switching layouts, if you don&rsquo;t count that I&rsquo;ve
been using the US keyboard instead of the Spanish one for ten years now, and
one hour with the Moonlander made me switch to Colemak, moving from 90 words
per minute to 5. This deserves a post.</p>
<p>This leads us to the following topic: i3wm. I&rsquo;ve been a GNOME user since I
joined Red Hat. Before that, like most Linux users, I played with everything
under the sun. GNOME 2, KDE 3 &amp; 4, Xfce4, Openbox, Fluxbox, AwesomeWM, DWM,
i3wm, etc. GNOME 2 was my first desktop, and since the release of 3, I&rsquo;ve been
complaining about it. But it gets the job done, and joining my team was already
wild enough to waste additional time tinkering. I did the right thing, but now
was a good time for a change. Apart from the issues with the layout, the way
GNOME handles windows makes this keyboard impossible to use. So I switched to
i3wm. So far, I feel at home. I&rsquo;ll write about it too.</p>
<p>Remember the &ldquo;mark this point&rdquo; at the beginning of this section? I wrote that
with the new keyboard. The rest, including this, with my regular keyboard. Only
that section took 1 hour to write.</p>
<h3 id="books">Books.</h3>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have enough time nor the force of will to read, but it was the Day of
The Book in Spain! YAY. I got two books: Discourse on the Method by Ren√©
Descartes and The Bonfire of the Vanities by Tom Wolfe. I&rsquo;ll make time for them
this week.</p>

every week is a good week.</p>

<p>I am still working on the final notes of a port to PPC64LE. Nothing exciting
happened, nor I moved the needle that much.</p>
<h2 id="fedora">Fedora</h2>
<p>I started working correctly in a merge between the Go spec files of CentOS
Stream 9 and Fedora. The idea is to lower the barrier of working with Go and
creating new Go packages by making CentOS and. Therefore, RHEL behaves more
similarly to what we do in Fedora. At least for now, the first step is to
create just one spec file that builds correctly in both OS.</p>
<h2 id="personal-stuff">Personal stuff</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been working for a while now (that&rsquo;s an understatement) on a port of <a href="https://github.com/go-delve/delve/pull/2963">Delve
to PPC64LE</a>.
The port is functional, but there are a lot of tests that fail.</p>
<p>I invested a significant amount of time working on the port this week. A few
things have changed that made the task harder than it used to be. I used to
have a private lab machine for this, but I needed to retire it for technical
infrastructure reasons. This difference doesn&rsquo;t change the workflow, but it did
change something I didn&rsquo;t recall when I started. We use internally a tool named
Beaker which allows you to request machines. It&rsquo;s easy to request machines from
the web interface, or if you request the same thing over and over again, like
me, you can define the requirements in an XML and run something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">bkr job-submit --wait ./machine.xml
</code></pre></div><p>I also have a <a href="https://github.com/alexsaezm/dotfiles/blob/main/scripts/.local/scripts/beaker-sync">script that allows me to sync my local copy of my code with every single change</a>.
After syncing everything for the first time, I ran the test suite and found
that 274 tests failed. Which was too much considering that I only had 5 tests with
issues. My surprise came when I saw the already fixed test failing. As I did a
rebase recently (never again in my life I&rsquo;ll do a rebase of a pull request this
big before fixing every open issue), I thought I screwed it somehow.</p>
<p>After entering panic mode and wasting hours trying to see where I made a
mistake, I realized that I was using an old unpatched version of the compiler
where the <code>runtime.Breakpoint</code> function triggers a <code>SIGSEGV</code>. So I invested a
little time in creating a small script that automatically uses <code>gotip</code> with each
new Beaker request.</p>
<p>Unproductive week.</p>

<h3 id="blog">Blog</h3>
<p>I worked on a new theme for my blog, but it still needs to be finished. I have yet to learn about web design, but it&rsquo;s fun to step outside your comfort zone and do things.</p>

			 <p>Since joining Red Hat in 2019, I&rsquo;ve been sending weekly email reports. At
first, I found the process odd. But it has grown on me. These are the things
I did or happened to me that I can (or want to) publicly share.</p>
<h2 id="fedora">Fedora</h2>
<h3 id="delve">Delve</h3>
<p>This is one of those embarrassing moments and, at the same time, relieving.
Delve, the Go debugger, is available in Fedora!</p>
<p>Delve was already orphaned as a Package in Fedora when I joined my current
team. Usually, Fedora retires packages when it fails to rebuild in the mass
rebuild phase of a new release. After a few weeks as retired, it becomes an
orphaned package.</p>
<p>The process to un-orphan a package is simple; it is the same as a new package
with the distinction that the repository already exists. Nothing special.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been interested in taking the package since 2019. I maintain Delve on RHEL
and contribute upstream to the project, so why not in the Linux distribution I
use daily? But it was never a priority for different reasons. And the longer
you leave the package, the harder it becomes to bring it back to life due to
new dependencies.</p>
<p>Thankfully, all the current dependencies are packaged in Fedora; I own some of
them.</p>
<p>It took a few weeks to nail down all of the issues. First, the package review
process could have been faster. Christmas, the reviewer was busy with the more
important stuff, and I was busy with more important stuff&hellip; Then, the
problems. A macro in the build phase hid a minor issue in one of the
dependencies:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">/usr/lib/golang/pkg/tool/linux_amd64/compile -o $WORK/b142/_pkg_.a -trimpath

</code></pre></div><p>The problem was related to a different version in one of the dependencies. Go,
as in 1.20.1, ships with go-dap 0.6 but in Fedora, we have 0.7, and there&rsquo;s a
change in a return object. I found the real problem after overriding the
%gobuild macro. The solution: I patched the offending line. <a href="https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/delve/blob/rawhide/f/add_address_operator_for_go-dap_compatibility.patch">You can see the
patch
here</a>.
This patch will go away in the next release of Delve.</p>
<p>By the way, I nice flag for this situation was the -work: <code>go build -work</code>. It
prints the name of the temporary work directory and doesn&rsquo;t delete it when
exiting. This allowed me to move around in the mock environment.</p>
<p>Another relevant thing about this package is that it doesn&rsquo;t provide a -devel
package.</p>
<h3 id="go">Go</h3>
<p>Thanks to mroche and buckaroogeek for their pull requests. I was immersed in
the Delve package and forgot to update Go to 1.20.2 and 1.19.7.</p>
<p>This reminds me that this week there was a <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/71Wg3N0IZk0/m/xchF2bEZAgAJ">security
announcement</a>.
That means I will probably do a few updates next week.</p>
<h2 id="personal-stuff">Personal stuff</h2>
<h3 id="dotfiles">Dotfiles</h3>
<p>For an extended period, I&rsquo;ve been doing, and, like everybody else, custom
solutions to my dotfiles. I only have a little stuff because I&rsquo;m used to only
customizing my tools as little as possible. I&rsquo;ve been working on NeoVim a lot
recently and did some modifications on my bashrc, so I wanted a better
solution. Enters stow. Now I can run make, and it will link all the dotfiles to
my repository. Elegant and simple.</p>
<h3 id="books">Books</h3>
<p>I finished Learning to Pray in the Age of Technique by Gon√ßalo M. Tavares. It
was a recommendation from a close friend, and it just blew my mind. It&rsquo;s a
hard-to-sallow book. But what caught my attention is not the story but how it
is narrated. It might seem like the author is doing everything considered a
lousy narrative technique. But it works. Every single sentence is as strong as
the one before. Short chapters that drill your brain with the ideas of a
twisted man.</p>
<h3 id="movies-and-tv-shows">Movies and tv shows</h3>
<p>I had the opportunity to watch John Wick 4 and Tetris (really enjoyed this
one). Almost finished The Simpsons (I&rsquo;ve been watching the whole show in
English, from season 1 to now, 32). I&rsquo;ve been suffering since season 20.</p>
<h3 id="videogames">Videogames</h3>
<p>Played Kirby&rsquo;s Return to Dream Land and Ghost of Tsushima.</p>
<h3 id="training">Training</h3>
<p>I stopped running a few months ago due to an injury on my right leg
(periostitis). I ran a short and absolutely horrible run this week. But it was
the first one in months. No pain at all. I plan to start training again in the
mornings like I used to before the injury in a few days if everything goes as
planned.</p>

			 <p>I need to confess something. I was surprised to find out how big <a href="https://fosdem.org/2023/">FOSDEM</a>
is. I was aware of its relevance, but seeing it in first person is
mind-blowing. This was my first time attending; it won&rsquo;t be the last.</p>
<h2 id="the-trip">The trip</h2>
<p>Traveling from the north of Spain to Brussels means a 7 hours trip, 5
hours of flights in total with 2 hours waiting between flights. I&rsquo;m
used to it at this point. Noise-canceling headphones and a book helped
tremendously.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t aware of the size of the event yet. While waiting in Madrid
for the second flight, I noticed that most people around me were also
attending FOSDEM.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/alexsaezm/status/1621469610787721217">Also, Ron Evans (@deadprogram) was on the same flight.</a></p>
<h2 id="talks-and-events">Talks and events</h2>
<p>Before the event, several people told me that I should only aim to
attend some of the talks. Mainly because it&rsquo;s impossible, the tracks
happen simultaneously, and meeting people in 3D is way more important.</p>
<p>I attended most of the talks at the
<a href="https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/go/">Go</a> and <a href="https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/binary_tools/">Binary tools</a>
devrooms. Two of my teammates were speakers there.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/bintools_libabigail/">Dodji&rsquo;s</a></li>
<li><a href="https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/godelve/">Derek&rsquo;s</a>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/alexsaezm/status/1621840553204752385">I think Derek passive-aggressive called me out for being late in a feature</a></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I also went to the Fedora contributor dinner with <a href="https://mikel.olasagasti.info/">Mikel</a>.</p>
<h2 id="meeting-new-people">Meeting new people</h2>
<p>This was the most important thing on the whole trip. And it&rsquo;s the
saddest part of my job. Even though I&rsquo;m not the most social animal in
the world, I like the people I work with. But we are a fully remote
team, and we couldn&rsquo;t meet for 2 years due to travel restrictions. When
I joined almost 4 years ago, I attended my team&rsquo;s annual gathering.
Still, several of the people I work with couldn&rsquo;t participate.</p>
<p>I hung out with new people, but most of my beers were with those
teammates. It is bizarre to talk daily for years with someone through
video calls and chats and see them in the flesh for the first time.
But those moments were by far the funniest ones.</p>
<p>Also, I had the opportunity to put a face on some people I talk to on
public projects. In particular, I enjoyed having dinner with the two
maintainers of Delve.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shower thought: The number of people from relevant projects at FOSDEM
was so huge that, luckily, nothing terrible happened. A lot of projects
would have suffered <strong>a lot</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="reflections-and-conclusions">Reflections and conclusions</h2>
<p>What can I say? It was a great experience. A weekend abroad, too many
beers, and the opportunity to talk to awesome people. I can&rsquo;t wait for
the next event.</p>
<p>Also, why did I travel with a 15&quot; laptop? My kingdom for an iPad where
I can work like a human. I reviewed two packages while waiting in the
airport at 4am and answered several emails. Next time, I&rsquo;ll bring my
phone only.</p>

			 <p>For my packaging work in Fedora, CentOS and RHEL, I use VSCode as my main editor.
And more often than not, I find myself working on a bug that requires more than one repository.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This happens because packages are &ldquo;small&rdquo; (you should look at Kubernetes&hellip;) projects that isolate the thing you want to manage, so a project with multiple dependencies usually involves more than one package. This is really common in Fedora, as <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Bundled_Libraries">bundling is discouraged</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>VSCode workspaces are a great feature that significantly helps me in those situations. How? I create a workspace with all the repositories and name it like the bug I&rsquo;m working on (for example, <code>rhbzXXXXX</code>, <code>rhbz</code> stands for Red Hat Bugzilla). And for quick access, I keep all of my workspace files in the same folder. As simple as it sounds. But this usually leads to a minor problem that can become annoying. What if the folders have the same, similar, or just a non-clear name? <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspaces#_multiroot-workspaces">VSCode and the documentation don&rsquo;t give us any solution</a>. But the workspace file is <code>JSON</code> and allows two parameters I didn&rsquo;t find in the documentation: <code>name</code> and <code>uri</code>. Not quite sure what exactly <code>uri</code> does, but as you can imagine, you can use <code>name</code> to modify the interface text and show more practical information. For example:</p>

<p>To open this file quickly, open the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-linux.pdf">Command Palette</a> (usually Ctrl + Shift + P), and look for &ldquo;Open Workspace Settings (JSON)&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only remaining issue is that workspaces don&rsquo;t allow you to specify the branch, so unless you use some CVS branch workflow or git-worktree, if you reopen an old workspace, it will be a mess. Although I never found myself in this situation.</p>

			 <p>I love <code>TODO</code> comments. And also <code>FIXME</code> comments. Well, I love any piece of non-code text that helps me with my tasks.
I know some people consider them smelly, and you must never use them or, at least, commit them.
I encountered many teachers at my university who always tell this to the students. And I think it is awful advice.</p>
<p>As far as I know, there are two main motivations against <code>TODO</code> comments.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, you should track these kinds of things in a bug or issue tracker.</li>
<li>Second, if you collaborate with multiple users, and everybody uses <code>TODO</code> comments, they lose all of the significance because you can&rsquo;t track what is yours and what is not.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first is a little more tricky to answer, and I can understand the sentiment, but only some things are worth the time, and some of the projects behave differently.
Generally, a <code>FIXME</code> or a <code>TODO</code> is usually smaller than a real issue or bug. A genuine issue should be tracked in a proper tool that allows a conversation among the developers at least. If it&rsquo;s a small thing like &ldquo;I need to check this later&rdquo;, use a <code>TODO</code> comment. Apart from that, they are totally ok if you are working on a pull request. You can remove them later if they are not meaningful.</p>
<p>The second is true. But not using comments is not the solution. The solution is to make them right! I&rsquo;m going to tell you the most simple and stupid thing I added to my workflow in the last months (I think I&rsquo;ve been doing this for a year now).</p>
<p>Instead of doing something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span style="color:#66d9ef">func</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">hello</span>() {
	<span style="color:#75715e">// TODO I need to change the text later
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>	<span style="color:#a6e22e">fmt</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">Println</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Hello world!&#34;</span>)
}
</code></pre></div><p>Try using your <strong>username</strong> in the control version system, in my case:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span style="color:#66d9ef">func</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">hello</span>() {
	<span style="color:#75715e">// TODO(alexsaezm) I need to change the text later
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>	<span style="color:#a6e22e">fmt</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">Println</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Hello world!&#34;</span>)
}
</code></pre></div><p>And then, here&rsquo;s the trick. <strong>A lot of IDE and editors allow filtering comments based on regular expressions!</strong></p>
<p>In my case, I mostly use Goland nowadays, but it works in all JetBrains products.</p>
<p>Go to the TODO tab, click on the filter icon, select <em>Edit filters</em>, and add something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/123741/2023/fa5409f49e.png" alt="My TODO filters" title="My TODO filters"></p>
<p>And enjoy your useful comments!</p>

<p>A deployment usually involves multiple steps that can be tricky. These days, we have a wide variety of tools to help us create reproducible deployments. In this article, I will show you how easy it is to build a basic RPM package.</p>
<p>We have had package managers for a while. <a href="https://rpm.org">RPM</a> and <a href="http://yum.baseurl.org">YUM</a> simplify installing, updating, or removing a piece of software. However, many companies use package managers only to install software from the operating system vendor and don‚Äôt use them for deployments. Creating a package can be daunting at first, but usually, it‚Äôs a rewarding exercise that can simplify your pipeline. As a test case, I will show you how to package a simple program written in <a href="https://go.dev">Go</a>.</p>
<h2 id="creating-the-package">Creating the package</h2>
<p>Many sites rely on configuration managers for deployment. For instance, a typical <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/products/ansible/overview">Ansible</a> playbook might be:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"> <span style="color:#f92672">tasks</span>:

</code></pre></div><p>A few notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>Source0</code> entry can be the source code repository, something like this: <code>https://github.com/user/my_app/archive/v%version.tar.gz</code>.</li>
<li>If you use a URL in <code>Source0</code>, you can issue <code>spectool -g my_app.spec</code> to download your source code.</li>
<li>Git allows you to quickly set up a tarball without creating a remote repository:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ git archive --format<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>tar.gz --prefix<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>my_app-1.0/ -o my_app-1.0.tar.gz HEAD
</code></pre></div><ul>
<li>The tarball content should look like this:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ tar tf my_app-1.0.tar.gz

my_app-1.0/main.go
my_app-1.0/my_app.service
</code></pre></div><h2 id="building-the-rpm">Building the RPM</h2>
<p>First, we need to create the rpmbuild structure and place our tarball inside the source&rsquo;s directory:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ rpmdev-setuptree
$ mv my_app-1.0.tar.gz ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES
</code></pre></div><p>Now, let‚Äôs build the RPM for <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel/overview">Red Hat Enterprise Linux</a> 8:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ rpmbuild -ba my_app.spec
</code></pre></div><p>And that&rsquo;s it!</p>
<p>You should be able to install the RPM now and start the service:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ sudo dnf install ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/my_app-1.0-1.el8.x86_64.rpm
$ sudo systemctl start my_app
$ curl -L http://localhost:8081
</code></pre></div><p>You should see the content of our <code>config.json</code> (which, by the way, is under <code>/etc/my_app</code>).</p>
<p>But what if we have a new version of our application? We only need to increase the spec file version and build it again. DNF will see that there is a new update available.</p>
<p>And if you are using a package repository, you only need to run <code>dnf update my_app</code>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you want to delve more into the idea of incorporating RPM files in your deployments, I suggest looking at the <a href="https://rpm-packaging-guide.github.io">RPM Packaging Guide</a> and the <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines">Fedora Packaging Guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>Also, a variety of exciting tools are available to help with the build process or even create repositories for you to use, such as <a href="https://github.com/rpm-software-management/mock">mock</a>, <a href="https://pagure.io/fedpkg">fedpkg</a>, <a href="https://pagure.io/copr/copr">COPR</a>, and <a href="https://pagure.io/koji/">Koji</a>. These tools can help you in complex scenarios with multiple dependencies, complex steps, or multiple architectures.</p>
<p>Note that the workflow demonstrated in this article is also applicable to Fedora and to CentOS Stream.</p>

			 <p>Recently I started using <code>gh</code> for working with my forks. Before that I used to add the remotes manually.</p>
<p>When cloning a fork, <code>gh</code> adds the original repository as a <code>upstream</code> remote which is what I used to do manually, but if you try to find the branches, you&rsquo;ll find that it only tracks the default one.</p>
<p>For tracking all of the branches in the <code>upstream</code> remote too, you just need to find the <code>fetch</code> line under the <code>upstream</code> section in the <code>.git/config</code> file.</p>
<p>For example, this is the content of my <code>.git/config</code> after cloning my <code>go</code> fork:</p>

			 <p>Mr. Elon Musk now owns Twitter, Inc., which makes many people angry. I think I&rsquo;m mad too, but after pausing to think about my feelings since the <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1585341984679469056/">sink tweet</a>, I realized that even if <a href="http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/mobile/000/023/021/e02e5ffb5f980cd8262cf7f0ae00a4a9_press-x-to-doubt-memes-memesuper-la-noire-doubt-meme_419-238.jpg">he fixes the platform</a>, my relationship with the tool is not healthy.</p>
<p>And who knows? You might be barking at the same tree as I was.</p>
<h2 id="those-filthy-users">Those filthy users</h2>
<p>It is, of course, an opinion article, but I think <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/28/23428132/elon-musk-twitter-acquisition-problems-speech-moderation">&ldquo;Welcome to hell, Elon&rdquo;</a> nails it. Stop reading this page and check it right now. I&rsquo;ll wait.</p>
<p>Back? Great.</p>
<p>Ok, Twitter has enormous issues and challenges ahead.</p>
<p>We love drama. It&rsquo;s part of our lives, and Twitter knows it. The <a href="https://twitter.com/explore">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening&rdquo;</a> is like the wall of a restroom at the filthiest pub in the city. Quick and short opinions have more weight than links to long reads (apparently, <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/linkless-tweets-experiment">tweets with links get less engagement somehow</a>). Drama makes money, and you can&rsquo;t make drama taming your feelings first.</p>
<p>There might be some technological solutions, but generally, the problem is the users and their interactions. Those filthy users.</p>
<p>Twitter relations (followers and following) differ from friendship on other platforms. They are directional links in the graph of user accounts. Facebook&rsquo;s friendship is, for example, bidirectional. You and I need to be friends. On Twitter, I can follow accounts they don&rsquo;t know about me. Is this bad? Of course not! It&rsquo;s what brought me to Twitter in the first place. But that, plus the power dynamic created by the followers/following ratio, generates mob mentality, harassment, and echo chambers. It also creates a false feeling of social belonging: you might think you are part of a group, and the group doesn&rsquo;t even know you are there.</p>
<p>And I am also tired of the constant race to win followers. Recently I saw a conversation on Twitter about why very few accounts write about complex programming things, and thousands of them talk about almost hello-world-style things. &ldquo;Learn how to code JS in 5 tweets&rdquo; is a thing. The answer is simple, at least for me: complex things take a lot of time and are error-prone. Simple stuff where you can&rsquo;t delve more is easy to read and easy to retweet. Engagement equals traffic, and that means money. And, to add more to my point, let&rsquo;s assume some accounts talk about complex stuff (because they exist). Is Twitter a nice place to read it? What is better, 40 tweets about a security flaw or a blog post?</p>
<p>Are blogs better than Twitter? Hell no, they are different formats. Both have their place. Also, blogs have their own issues. In this life and age of engagement, they are way more complex to monetize than Instagram or Twitter accounts. Writing doesn&rsquo;t sell as much as a photo and twenty-four hashtags.
And let&rsquo;s be real. I&rsquo;m praising for blogs but I don&rsquo;t write at all. Again, writing is hard.</p>
<p>But it must have something nice, right? Yes, indeed. There are tons of incredible accounts. Accounts like <a href="https://twitter.com/Foone">Foone&rsquo;s</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/mpc7500v2">MPC7500&rsquo;s</a> are superb. I love them! You can see they do that just for the sake of doing it. No second hidden reasons. No business engagement motivations.</p>
<p>But apart from all of this, there is an additional issue. One that I&rsquo;m not sure I can fix. And the problem is that I might be&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="an-addict">An addict.</h2>
<p>Well, that sounds a little too dramatic, isn&rsquo;t it? But it&rsquo;s catchy.</p>
<p>And true, somehow. I checked Twitter five times and tweeted a bunch of times while drafting this blog post.
And of course, just right after publishing this, I&rsquo;ll post it on Twitter. How ironic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a single child. And I was always really introspective. My whole life was me in silence, playing video games, playing with Lego bricks, or reading comics and books.</p>
<p>For work and university, I used to travel by train in silence every day for almost eight years, for more than 2 hours in total without Internet (come to where I live, we have huge mountains and a lot of tunnels), no music, just me and my thoughts. And now I cannot stare at my laptop without typing Twitter in the address bar when something I&rsquo;m doing is hard, or it&rsquo;s just taking time.</p>
<p>I used to try over and over again to solve things. I still do. You should ask my girlfriend about when I wasted more than one hour repeating the exact same movements to obtain a secret power-up in the last Metroid. Or how I daily run for one hour straight with the same song in my ears (for the past 10 years, I&rsquo;ve been listening to the same song when I run). But I see my ability to focus on tough things seriously drained. Reading is more challenging than ever, and coding&hellip; let&rsquo;s leave that out, please.</p>
<p>Does the test run in less than 5 seconds? No? Twitter.
Can I reproduce the bug? No? Twitter.</p>
<p>That kind of behavior is me not knowing better. It&rsquo;s easy for me to play the same DJ Max song for 3 hours straight until I get the maximum possible score (being there, done that) because I obtain direct pleasure from the challenge. But when the path could be more fun, like when you do not understand why a piece of code does not work, Twitter is two keystrokes away.</p>
<p>I have an excuse, though. I learned that you should not wait for that initial hype feeling to jump into doing something but start and give yourself 10 or 15 minutes into the task. If you are stuck, stop, stand, walk for a few minutes and give it another try. Not just go to Twitter.</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t I know this? I have no idea, but that might explain why I&rsquo;m a terrible student and why I worked as System Administrator for years. It&rsquo;s the most active job in the IT industry! Everything is a fire to tame!</p>
<p>When I switched to a DevOps-like role, and now that I&rsquo;m working on compilers and debuggers, I found out everything needs to be carefully thought out&hellip; Then I found the real struggle of deep focus sessions.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not saying System Administration is straightforward and lacks deep work, far from that. I&rsquo;m just saying it is or was way more active. Fix it or die! Time pressure was a constant. I was hooked!</p>
<h2 id="so-what-now">So what now?</h2>
<p>I usually do what some people call detox once in a while, and like a real addict, after a detox, I bounce again into my drug. And if it isn&rsquo;t Twitter, it is binge-watching YouTube videos.</p>
<p>YouTube is a problem on its own. I can get a lot of value from some videos, but it&rsquo;s a form of procrastination. So I am trying to figure out what to do with it. I&rsquo;ll follow the essential channels using feeds, the ones I always want to see the videos and avoid entering Youtube as much as possible. And download to my NAS (yes, I&rsquo;m evil), like those documentary-like videos.</p>
<p>But Twitter&hellip; I don&rsquo;t think I get any value. I&rsquo;m not quite sure, to be honest. But even if I do, I want to pause my usage for an extended period and see if I really need it. Luckily I can follow some of the most critical accounts for my needs using RSS. <a href="https://feedly.com">Feedly</a> and <a href="https://inoreader.com">Inoreader</a> have Twitter support, and you can always use <a href="https://nitter.net">Nitter</a>.</p>
<p>And write more here. Of course. Not only for other people but for me. Because putting thoughts in order is more challenging than we might think, but it helps us learn and grow immensely.</p>

<p>This is just the usual Fedora testing workflow but with a container in the middle,
so nothing really relevant, to be honest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I made a massive mistake in the Fedora release process a few Go minor releases ago (around 1.16.1, I think).
Basically, the Go package was stuck in the previous version.</p>
<p>So now that I&rsquo;m making another two releases (1.15.12 for Fedora 33 and 1.16.4 for Fedora 34 and Rawhide),
I wondered how I can try my ready-to-be-published version in a container.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I participate in the Fedora community but I never tested a package. Shame on me.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-release">The release</h2>
<p>First of all, let&rsquo;s check what is included in Go <code>1.15.12</code> by looking at
the <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/milestone/209?closed=1">upstream milestone</a>.
At some point in the release process, we&rsquo;ll need to specify if we solve something
with this release already tracked in the Fedora bug tracker.</p>
<p><em>/me looks bugs and reads comments&hellip;</em></p>
<p>Alright! It looks like we only have <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/45711">issue 45711</a> which seems to be <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1958343">bug 1958343</a>.</p>
<p>Well, I guess we can start the release process:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#75715e"># Clone the fedora repository</span>

<span style="color:#75715e"># The real build</span>
fedpkg build
<span style="color:#75715e"># After a while we can do the release with the information of the bug</span>
fedpkg update
</code></pre></div><p>A quick summary of what we have:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/golang/c/b2a8f76814f5c9246873fd78cd2c6c32fa110605?branch=f33">The commit</a></li>

<li><a href="https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=67617917">The build</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2021-a50122f73b">The release</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-testing">The testing</h2>
<p>Now that our release is on testing, we can create a container, subscribe to
that testing channel, and see if I screwed it again :). And this is an excellent
excuse to use Toolbox.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">toolbox create --release <span style="color:#ae81ff">33</span> 
toolbox enter --container fedora-toolbox-33
</code></pre></div><p>Now we should be inside a container. A nice thing about Toolbox is that we don&rsquo;t have
any of the packages installed on the host, just those that came with the image.
Still, we have access to all of our configurations and files. Pretty neat to test stuff, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>We can install Go, check the version, and then, once the package we submitted reaches the
testing state, update it by using the updates-testing repository:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#75715e"># First we need the stable package</span>
sudo yum install golang
<span style="color:#75715e"># Output: go version go1.15.11 linux/amd64</span>
go version
<span style="color:#75715e"># The magic trick</span>
sudo dnf upgrade --enablerepo<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>updates-testing golang
<span style="color:#75715e"># Output: go version go1.15.12 linux/amd64</span>
go version
</code></pre></div><blockquote>
<p>If you use VSCode, you can now jump into the container using <code>Attach to Running Container</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are interested in helping out the Fedora community, <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:Updates_Testing">feel free to read the wiki</a>,
and if you don&rsquo;t have spare machines to try new and potentially unstable stuff, you can use this container approach with a lot of different packages
(forget about kernel testing for example) or swap the container for a VM.</p>
<p>Happy testing :)</p>

			 <p>I like blogs. In this day and age of quick and short messages, I think they still have their place.</p>
<p>Often, when documentation doesn&rsquo;t cut it, a blog pops up to save my day. Sometimes, those blogs are even from coworkers that had the same problem!
I find that fascinating.</p>
<p>To be honest, I tried a bunch of times to have one. So why now? Why again? Well, I was reading <a href="https://siliconislandblog.wordpress.com">Alberto Ruiz&rsquo;s blog</a>, and I saw he has entries from 2006. I felt sad because I remember writing stuff around that date when I was a teenager, and now (probably for the best) that stuff is lost. But, in ten years, I would love to have things written down with more information than <del>140</del> 280 characters.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s see how it goes.</p>
<p>Oh right! I should migrate old blog posts from previous attempts, but that might take some time as they are, under my current standards, way bad written.</p>
