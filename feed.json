I had a great time having lunch with my family at [Ca'l Xabú](http://calxabu.es).\n\n### Blog\n\nI worked on a new theme for my blog, but it still needs to be finished. I have yet to learn about web design, but it's fun to step outside your comfort zone and do things.\n\n### Books\n\nI started Foundation by Asimov a few months ago, and the first book was terrific, but I got stuck in the second one. I continued reading it, but I'm not enjoying it at all.\n\n### Movies and tv shows\n\nI watched The Super Mario Bros Movie and Old. And I enjoyed both a lot.\n\n### Videogames\nI finished Kirby's Return to Dream Land, the game was straightforward, but the additional levels are pretty fun.\n",

What if the folders have the same, similar, or just a non-clear name? [VSCode and the documentation don't give us any solution](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspaces#_multiroot-workspaces). But the workspace file is `JSON` and allows two parameters I didn't find in the documentation: `name` and `uri`. Not quite sure what exactly `uri` does, but as you can imagine, you can use `name` to modify the interface text and show more practical information. For example:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"folders\": [\n        {\n            \"path\": \"../src/gitlab.com/redhat/centos-stream/rpms/go-rpm-macros\",\n            \"name\": \"CentOS Stream macros\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"path\": \"../src/src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/go-rpm-macros\",\n            \"name\": \"Fedora macros\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"settings\": {}\n}\n```\n\n> To open this file quickly, open the [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-linux.pdf) (usually Ctrl + Shift + P), and look for \"Open Workspace Settings (JSON)\".\n\nThe only remaining issue is that workspaces don't allow you to specify the branch, so unless you use some CVS branch workflow or git-worktree, if you reopen an old workspace, it will be a mess. Although I never found myself in this situation.\n",

These days, we have a wide variety of tools to help us create reproducible deployments.

				"content_text": "\n> This post was originally published on Red Hat Developer. To read the original post, visit [Build your own RPM package with a sample Go program](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/05/21/build-your-own-rpm-package-sample-go-program).\n\nA deployment usually involves multiple steps that can be tricky. These days, we have a wide variety of tools to help us create reproducible deployments. In this article, I will show you how easy it is to build a basic RPM package.\n\nWe have had package managers for a while. [RPM](https://rpm.org) and [YUM](http://yum.baseurl.org) simplify installing, updating, or removing a piece of software. However, many companies use package managers only to install software from the operating system vendor and don’t use them for deployments. Creating a package can be daunting at first, but usually, it’s a rewarding exercise that can simplify your pipeline. As a test case, I will show you how to package a simple program written in [Go](https://go.dev).\n\n## Creating the package\n\nMany sites rely on configuration managers for deployment. For instance, a typical [Ansible](https://developers.redhat.com/products/ansible/overview) playbook might be:\n\n```yaml\n tasks:\n    - name: 'Copy the artifact'\n      copy:\n        src: 'my_app'\n        dest: '/usr/bin/my_app'\n      \n    - name: 'Copy configuration files'\n      template:\n        src: config.json\n        dest: /etc/my_app/config.json\n```\n\nOf course, a real-life playbook will include more steps, like checking the previous installation or handling services. But why not use something like this?\n\n```yaml\n  tasks:\n    - name: 'Install my_app'\n      yum:\n        name: 'my_app'\n```\n\nNow, let’s see our Go application that serves up a webpage. Here's the `main.go` file:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"encoding/json\"\n    \"flag\"\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"io/ioutil\"\n    \"log\"\n    \"net/http\"\n)\n\ntype config struct {\n    Text string `json:\"string\"`\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\n    var filename = flag.String(\"config\", \"config.json\", \"\")\n    flag.Parse()\n\n    data, err := ioutil.ReadFile(*filename)\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatalln(err)\n    }\n\n    var config config\n    err = json.Unmarshal(data, &config)\n\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatalln(err)\n    }\n\n    http.HandleFunc(\"/\", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n        fmt.Fprintf(w, config.Text)\n    })\n\n    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(\":8081\", nil))\n\n}\n```\n\nAnd our `config.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"string\": \"Hello world :)\"\n}\n```\n\nIf we run this program, we should see a web page with the config.json text in port 8081. It's far from production-ready, but it will serve as an example.\n\n## Adding services\n\nWhat about a service? Adding services is an excellent way to unify the management of an application, so let’s create our `my_app.service`:\n\n```bash\n[Unit]\nDescription=My App\n\n[Service]\nType=simple\nExecStart=/usr/bin/my_app -config /etc/my_app/config.json\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n```\n\nEvery time we want to deploy our application, we need to:\n\n1. Compile the project.\n2. Copy it to `/usr/bin/my_app`.\n3. Copy the `config.json` file to `/etc/my_app/config.json`.\n4. Copy `my_app.service` to `/etc/systemd/system/`.\n5. Start the service.\n\n## Creating the spec file\n\nLike Ansible, an RPM package needs a definition file where we specify the installation steps, the dependencies, and other things that we might need to install our application on a server:\n\n```bash\n$ sudo dnf install git\n$ sudo dnf module install go-toolset\n$ sudo dnf groupinstall \"RPM Development Tools\"\n```\n\nWith all of this installed, we are ready to create the package definition file, also known as the spec file:\n\n```bash\n$ rpmdev-newspec my_app.spec\n```\n\nA spec file can be tricky, but we will keep this simple to appreciate the power of the tool:\n\n```yaml\nName:           my_app\nVersion:        1.0\nRelease:        1%{?dist}\nSummary:        A simple web app\n\nLicense:        GPLv3\nSource0:        %{name}-%{version}.tar.gz\n\nBuildRequires:  golang\nBuildRequires:  systemd-rpm-macros\n\nProvides:       %{name} = %{version}\n\n%description\nA simple web app\n\n%global debug_package %{nil}\n\n%prep\n%autosetup\n\n\n%build\ngo build -v -o %{name}\n\n\n%install\ninstall -Dpm 0755 %{name} %{buildroot}%{_bindir}/%{name}\ninstall -Dpm 0755 config.json %{buildroot}%{_sysconfdir}/%{name}/config.json\ninstall -Dpm 644 %{name}.service %{buildroot}%{_unitdir}/%{name}.service\n\n%check\n# go test should be here... :)\n\n%post\n%systemd_post %{name}.service\n\n%preun\n%systemd_preun %{name}.service\n\n%files\n%dir %{_sysconfdir}/%{name}\n%{_bindir}/%{name}\n%{_unitdir}/%{name}.service\n%config(noreplace) %{_sysconfdir}/%{name}/config.json\n\n\n%changelog\n* Wed May 19 2021 John Doe - 1.0-1\n- First release%changelog\n```\n\nA few notes:\n\n* The `Source0` entry can be the source code repository, something like this: `https://github.com/user/my_app/archive/v%version.tar.gz`.\n* If you use a URL in `Source0`, you can issue `spectool -g my_app.spec` to download your source code.\n* Git allows you to quickly set up a tarball without creating a remote repository:\n\n```bash\n$ git archive --format=tar.gz --prefix=my_app-1.0/ -o my_app-1.0.tar.gz HEAD\n```\n\n* The tarball content should look like this:\n\n```bash\n$ tar tf my_app-1.0.tar.gz \nmy_app-1.0/\nmy_app-1.0/config.json\nmy_app-1.0/main.go\nmy_app-1.0/my_app.service\n```\n\n## Building the RPM\n\nFirst, we need to create the rpmbuild structure and place our tarball inside the source's directory:\n\n```bash\n$ rpmdev-setuptree\n$ mv my_app-1.0.tar.gz ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES\n```\n\nNow, let’s build the RPM for [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel/overview) 8:\n\n```bash\n$ rpmbuild -ba my_app.spec\n```\n\nAnd that's it!\n\nYou should be able to install the RPM now and start the service:\n\n```bash\n$ sudo dnf install ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/my_app-1.0-1.el8.x86_64.rpm\n$ sudo systemctl start my_app\n$ curl -L http://localhost:8081\n```\n\nYou should see the content of our `config.json` (which, by the way, is under `/etc/my_app`).\n\nBut what if we have a new version of our application? We only need to increase the spec file version and build it again. DNF will see that there is a new update available.\n\nAnd if you are using a package repository, you only need to run `dnf update my_app`.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf you want to delve more into the idea of incorporating RPM files in your deployments, I suggest looking at the [RPM Packaging Guide](https://rpm-packaging-guide.github.io) and the [Fedora Packaging Guidelines](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines).\n\nAlso, a variety of exciting tools are available to help with the build process or even create repositories for you to use, such as [mock](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/mock), [fedpkg](https://pagure.io/fedpkg), [COPR](https://pagure.io/copr/copr), and [Koji](https://pagure.io/koji/). These tools can help you in complex scenarios with multiple dependencies, complex steps, or multiple architectures.\n\nNote that the workflow demonstrated in this article is also applicable to Fedora and to CentOS Stream.\n",

I think I&rsquo;m mad too, but after pausing to think about my feelings since the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1585341984679469056/\">sink tweet</a>, I realized that even if <a href=\"http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/mobile/000/023/021/e02e5ffb5f980cd8262cf7f0ae00a4a9_press-x-to-doubt-memes-memesuper-la-noire-doubt-meme_419-238.jpg\">he fixes the platform</a>, my relationship with the tool is not healthy.</p>\n<p>And who knows? You might be barking at the same tree as I was.</p>\n<h2 id=\"those-filthy-users\">Those filthy users</h2>\n<p>It is, of course, an opinion article, but I think <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/28/23428132/elon-musk-twitter-acquisition-problems-speech-moderation\">&ldquo;Welcome to hell, Elon&rdquo;</a> nails it. Stop reading this page and check it right now. I&rsquo;ll wait.</p>\n<p>Back? Great.</p>\n<p>Ok, Twitter has enormous issues and challenges ahead.</p>\n<p>We love drama. It&rsquo;s part of our lives, and Twitter knows it. The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/explore\">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening&rdquo;</a> is like the wall of a restroom at the filthiest pub in the city. Quick and short opinions have more weight than links to long reads (apparently, <a href=\"https://blog.hootsuite.com/linkless-tweets-experiment\">tweets with links get less engagement somehow</a>). Drama makes money, and you can&rsquo;t make drama taming your feelings first.</p>\n<p>There might be some technological solutions, but generally, the problem is the users and their interactions. Those filthy users.</p>\n<p>Twitter relations (followers and following) differ from friendship on other platforms. They are directional links in the graph of user accounts. Facebook&rsquo;s friendship is, for example, bidirectional. You and I need to be friends. On Twitter, I can follow accounts they don&rsquo;t know about me. Is this bad? Of course not! It&rsquo;s what brought me to Twitter in the first place. But that, plus the power dynamic created by the followers/following ratio, generates mob mentality, harassment, and echo chambers. It also creates a false feeling of social belonging: you might think you are part of a group, and the group doesn&rsquo;t even know you are there.</p>\n<p>And I am also tired of the constant race to win followers. Recently I saw a conversation on Twitter about why very few accounts write about complex programming things, and thousands of them talk about almost hello-world-style things. &ldquo;Learn how to code JS in 5 tweets&rdquo; is a thing. The answer is simple, at least for me: complex things take a lot of time and are error-prone. Simple stuff where you can&rsquo;t delve more is easy to read and easy to retweet. Engagement equals traffic, and that means money. And, to add more to my point, let&rsquo;s assume some accounts talk about complex stuff (because they exist). Is Twitter a nice place to read it? What is better, 40 tweets about a security flaw or a blog post?</p>\n<p>Are blogs better than Twitter? Hell no, they are different formats. Both have their place. Also, blogs have their own issues. In this life and age of engagement, they are way more complex to monetize than Instagram or Twitter accounts. Writing doesn&rsquo;t sell as much as a photo and twenty-four hashtags.\nAnd let&rsquo;s be real. I&rsquo;m praising for blogs but I don&rsquo;t write at all. Again, writing is hard.</p>\n<p>But it must have something nice, right? Yes, indeed. There are tons of incredible accounts. Accounts like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Foone\">Foone&rsquo;s</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mpc7500v2\">MPC7500&rsquo;s</a> are superb. I love them!

				"content_text": "Mr. Elon Musk now owns Twitter, Inc., which makes many people angry. I think I'm mad too, but after pausing to think about my feelings since the [sink tweet](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1585341984679469056/), I realized that even if [he fixes the platform](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/mobile/000/023/021/e02e5ffb5f980cd8262cf7f0ae00a4a9_press-x-to-doubt-memes-memesuper-la-noire-doubt-meme_419-238.jpg), my relationship with the tool is not healthy.\n\nAnd who knows? You might be barking at the same tree as I was.\n<!--more-->\n\n## Those filthy users\nIt is, of course, an opinion article, but I think [\"Welcome to hell, Elon\"](https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/28/23428132/elon-musk-twitter-acquisition-problems-speech-moderation) nails it. Stop reading this page and check it right now. I'll wait.\n\nBack? Great.\n\nOk, Twitter has enormous issues and challenges ahead.\n\nWe love drama. It's part of our lives, and Twitter knows it. The [\"What's happening\"](https://twitter.com/explore) is like the wall of a restroom at the filthiest pub in the city. Quick and short opinions have more weight than links to long reads (apparently, [tweets with links get less engagement somehow](https://blog.hootsuite.com/linkless-tweets-experiment)). Drama makes money, and you can't make drama taming your feelings first.\n\nThere might be some technological solutions, but generally, the problem is the users and their interactions. Those filthy users.\n\nTwitter relations (followers and following) differ from friendship on other platforms. They are directional links in the graph of user accounts. Facebook's friendship is, for example, bidirectional. You and I need to be friends. On Twitter, I can follow accounts they don't know about me. Is this bad? Of course not! It's what brought me to Twitter in the first place. But that, plus the power dynamic created by the followers/following ratio, generates mob mentality, harassment, and echo chambers. It also creates a false feeling of social belonging: you might think you are part of a group, and the group doesn't even know you are there.\n\nAnd I am also tired of the constant race to win followers. Recently I saw a conversation on Twitter about why very few accounts write about complex programming things, and thousands of them talk about almost hello-world-style things. \"Learn how to code JS in 5 tweets\" is a thing. The answer is simple, at least for me: complex things take a lot of time and are error-prone. Simple stuff where you can't delve more is easy to read and easy to retweet.
