The reason is to avoid arriving back home starving and do binge-eat. I can arrive and have a proper meal and go back to work. It works for now, although the heat will be a problem soon.</p>\n\n<h2>2024-03-19</h2>\n\n<p>A 45 minutes easy run in zone 2. I usually run these kinds of training in the treadmill. I can put some music or an audiobook, and keep a steady, controlled pace that allows me to be in zone 2.

				"content_html": "<p>While I usually for no specific reason write in English, this post is written in Spanish due to the absurd <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/next/2024/03/23/spains-high-court-orders-block-on-telegram-messaging-app-as-a-precautionary-measure\">precautionary measure of blocking Telegram</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Si vais a usar Ubuntu, <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/rameerez/8debfc790e965009ca2949c3b4580b91\">esta guia es genial</a>, adem√°s incluye alguna cosa como registrar el proxy que yo he obviado a proposito.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hay muchas formas de saltarse un bloqueo a Telegram. Desde cambiar los DNS, hasta usar una VPN pero, en mi opini√≥n, la mejor es <a href=\"https://github.com/TelegramMessenger/MTProxy\">MTProxy</a>. Aunque el proyecto parece parado desde hace unos a√±os, todav√≠a funciona y para salir de un apuro, es una soluci√≥n ideal.</p>\n<p><del>Todav√≠a no se sabe como van a bloquear el uso de la plataforma (aunque viendo como se ha hecho hasta ahora este tipo de cosas, van a bloquear los dominios con casi total seguridad). Si este es el caso, yo personalmente uso <a href=\"https://nextdns.io/\">NextDNS</a> para bloquear ciertas p√°ginas.</del></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eldiario.es/politica/audiencia-nacional-suspende-bloqueo-telegram-pide-policia-informe-incidencia-medida_1_11240637.html\">El bloqueo no va a suceder</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sin embargo, cambiar los DNS no me parece una medida adecuada de cara a seguir usando Telegram. No siempre es factible cambiarlos. Algunos routers suministrados por proveedores de servidores de Internet no permiten hacer estas modificaciones.</p>\n<p>¬øY una VPN? Esta soluci√≥n es un poco dr√°stica. Por funcionar, funciona. Pero, salvo que sepas lo que estas haciendo, estar√≠as pasando todo el trafico del dispositivo por la VPN. E igual no es algo que te interesa. Igual no quieres estar saliendo por Francia las 24 horas del dia. O igual no puedes tener todos tus dispositivos en una VPN como por ejemplo el ordenador del trabajo. Adem√°s de que los servicios de VPN son de dudosa fiabilidad. Si vas a seguir esta ruta, mi recomendaci√≥n es que te montes tu mismo la VPN, ya sea usando <a href=\"https://openvpn.net/\">OpenVPN</a> o <a href=\"https://www.wireguard.com/\">WireGuard</a>, o que uses un servicio por el que est√°s pagando y del que te f√≠as. Yo personalmente uso la primera opci√≥n pero <a href=\"https://protonvpn.com/\">ProtonVPN</a> me ha dado buen resultado en el pasado.</p>\n<p>¬øPor qu√© un proxy y en particular MTProxy? Pues bastante sencillo. Telegram soporta esto de manera nativa en todas las aplicaciones oficiales. Soporta SOCKS5 y MTProto y una vez tengas montado el servicio, puedes compartir el enlace con la gente que te importa. El tr√°fico de Telegram es lo √∫nico que va a trav√©s del proxy, no afectando en absoluto a la conexi√≥n del resto de aplicaciones del dispositivo.</p>\n<p>As√≠ que si tienes una m√°quina con Fedora, CentOS Stream 9 o RHEL 9 (puede que funcione con versiones anteriores pero no lo he probado), sigue estos pasos. Yo por el momento uso Linode y un servidor en Amsterdam. El proveedor de la maquina virtual es lo de menos. Aseg√∫rate tambi√©n de que sabes como proteger y mantener un equipo expuesto p√∫blicamente.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Se asume que la m√°quina esta limpia, si es una m√°quina que ya tenias, puede que los pasos del firewall te den problemas. Pero si ya tienes una m√°quina es que sabes lo que haces :)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Vamos a rodar todas las instrucciones como root y est√°n muy basadas en lo que dice la propia documentaci√≥n, con algunos peque√±os cambios para ponerla al d√≠a.

				"content_text": "While I usually for no specific reason write in English, this post is written in Spanish due to the absurd [precautionary measure of blocking Telegram](https://www.euronews.com/next/2024/03/23/spains-high-court-orders-block-on-telegram-messaging-app-as-a-precautionary-measure).\n\n---\n\n> Si vais a usar Ubuntu, [esta guia es genial](https://gist.github.com/rameerez/8debfc790e965009ca2949c3b4580b91), adem√°s incluye alguna cosa como registrar el proxy que yo he obviado a proposito.\n\nHay muchas formas de saltarse un bloqueo a Telegram. Desde cambiar los DNS, hasta usar una VPN pero, en mi opini√≥n, la mejor es [MTProxy](https://github.com/TelegramMessenger/MTProxy). Aunque el proyecto parece parado desde hace unos a√±os, todav√≠a funciona y para salir de un apuro, es una soluci√≥n ideal.\n\n~~Todav√≠a no se sabe como van a bloquear el uso de la plataforma (aunque viendo como se ha hecho hasta ahora este tipo de cosas, van a bloquear los dominios con casi total seguridad). Si este es el caso, yo personalmente uso [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io/) para bloquear ciertas p√°ginas.~~\n\n> [El bloqueo no va a suceder](https://www.eldiario.es/politica/audiencia-nacional-suspende-bloqueo-telegram-pide-policia-informe-incidencia-medida_1_11240637.html).\n\nSin embargo, cambiar los DNS no me parece una medida adecuada de cara a seguir usando Telegram. No siempre es factible cambiarlos. Algunos routers suministrados por proveedores de servidores de Internet no permiten hacer estas modificaciones.\n\n¬øY una VPN? Esta soluci√≥n es un poco dr√°stica. Por funcionar, funciona. Pero, salvo que sepas lo que estas haciendo, estar√≠as pasando todo el trafico del dispositivo por la VPN. E igual no es algo que te interesa. Igual no quieres estar saliendo por Francia las 24 horas del dia. O igual no puedes tener todos tus dispositivos en una VPN como por ejemplo el ordenador del trabajo. Adem√°s de que los servicios de VPN son de dudosa fiabilidad. Si vas a seguir esta ruta, mi recomendaci√≥n es que te montes tu mismo la VPN, ya sea usando [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/) o [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/), o que uses un servicio por el que est√°s pagando y del que te f√≠as. Yo personalmente uso la primera opci√≥n pero [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/) me ha dado buen resultado en el pasado.\n\n¬øPor qu√© un proxy y en particular MTProxy? Pues bastante sencillo. Telegram soporta esto de manera nativa en todas las aplicaciones oficiales. Soporta SOCKS5 y MTProto y una vez tengas montado el servicio, puedes compartir el enlace con la gente que te importa. El tr√°fico de Telegram es lo √∫nico que va a trav√©s del proxy, no afectando en absoluto a la conexi√≥n del resto de aplicaciones del dispositivo.\n\nAs√≠ que si tienes una m√°quina con Fedora, CentOS Stream 9 o RHEL 9 (puede que funcione con versiones anteriores pero no lo he probado), sigue estos pasos. Yo por el momento uso Linode y un servidor en Amsterdam. El proveedor de la maquina virtual es lo de menos. Aseg√∫rate tambi√©n de que sabes como proteger y mantener un equipo expuesto p√∫blicamente.\n\n> Se asume que la m√°quina esta limpia, si es una m√°quina que ya tenias, puede que los pasos del firewall te den problemas. Pero si ya tienes una m√°quina es que sabes lo que haces :)\n\nVamos a rodar todas las instrucciones como root y est√°n muy basadas en lo que dice la propia documentaci√≥n, con algunos peque√±os cambios para ponerla al d√≠a. El servicio **no va** a estar rodando como root, tranquilo :P\n\nVamos a instalar las dependencias que necesitamos para compilar MTProxy.\n\n```bash\ndnf install openssl-devel zlib-devel\ndnf groupinstall \"Development tools\"\n```\n\nAhora necesitamos bajar el proyecto.\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/TelegramMessenger/MTProxy\ncd MTProxy\n```\n\nHay un problema actualmente en MTProxy si intentamos compilarlo, hace un tiempo un usuario abri√≥ una pull request con la soluci√≥n, as√≠ que vamos a aplicar su parche:\n\n```bash\ncurl -L -O https://patch-diff.githubusercontent.com/raw/TelegramMessenger/MTProxy/pull/531.patch\ngit am 531.patch\nrm -f 531.patch\n```\nPara compilarlo, solo tenemos que hacer:\n\n```bash\nmake\n```\n\nPuede que durante la compilaci√≥n veas algunos *warnings*, y como cualquier buena instalaci√≥n, vamos a obviarlos :P (En CentOS Stream 9 no los he visto pero si en Fedora 39, as√≠ que puede que se deba a diferentes ajustes en GCC, no le he dedicado mucho tiempo a esto).\n\nEn general, una aplicaci√≥n instalada a mano suele ponerse en `/opt` y ah√≠ es donde vamos a ponerla (lee `man hier` si tienes curiosidad).\n\n```bash\nmkdir /opt/MTProxy\ncp objs/bin/mtproto-proxy /opt/MTProxy/\ncd /opt/MTProxy/\n```\n\nAhora tenemos que hacernos con el secreto y la configuraci√≥n que nos da Telegram. La configuraci√≥n puede cambiar as√≠ que aconsejan renovarla a diario (candidato ideal para un cron :))\n\n```bash\ncurl -s https://core.telegram.org/getProxySecret -o proxy-secret\ncurl -s https://core.telegram.org/getProxyConfig -o proxy-multi.conf\n```\n\nEl contenido de `/opt/MTProxy` deber√≠a ser: `mtproto-proxy`, `proxy-multi.conf` y `proxy-secret`.\n\nAhora necesitamos el secreto que usaremos para validar nuestros clientes contra nuestro servidor. Puede ser cualquier cosa que te inventes, pero lo que sugiere el proyecto es ideal: simplemente guarda en alg√∫n lado la salida de esta instrucci√≥n:\n\n```bash\nhead -c 16 /dev/urandom | xxd -ps\n```\n\nNecesitamos asegurarnos de que el firewall que suele venir activado de serie no nos de problemas.\n\n```bash\nfirewall-cmd --permanent --new-service=MTProxy\nfirewall-cmd --permanent --service=MTProxy --add-port=4242/tcp\nfirewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=MTProxy\nfirewall-cmd --reload\n```\n\nSi todo ha ido bien, deber√≠as haber visto varios `success`. Pero siempre puedes comprobar que MTProxy esta listo en el el firewall con:\n\n```bash\nfirewall-cmd --list-all | grep services\n```\n\nAunque ya tenemos todo lo que necesitamos, la guinda en el pastel es configurar MTProxy como servicio que ruede como un usuario no privilegiado sin shell y sin home.\n\nPrimero creamos el usuario, y le damos permisos sobre `/opt/MTProxy`.\n\n```bash\nuseradd -M -s /sbin/nologin mtproxy\nchown -R mtproxy:mtproxy /opt/MTProxy\n```\n\nAhora, necesitamos crear el servicio. F√≠jate que necesitas modificar las lineas un poco para incluir el secreto que generamos antes de pegarlo en la terminal.\n\n```bash\ncat <<EOF > /etc/systemd/system/MTProxy.service\n[Unit]\nDescription=MTProxy\nAfter=network.target\n\n[Service]\nType=simple\nUser=mtproxy\nGroup=mtproxy\nWorkingDirectory=/opt/MTProxy\nExecStart=/opt/MTProxy/mtproto-proxy -H 4242 -S <EL SECRETO VA AQUI> --aes-pwd proxy-secret proxy-multi.conf --log mtproxy.log -M 1\nRestart=on-failure\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\nEOF\n```\nTras esto, ya estamos listos para rodar el servicio:\n\n```bash\nsystemctl daemon-reload\nsystemctl enable MTProxy.service\nsystemctl start MTProxy.service\nsystemctl status MTProxy.service\n```\n\nPara configurarlo f√°cilmente, adapta el siguiente enlace, o comp√°rtelo a quien quieras:\n\n```\nhttps://t.me/proxy?server=<LA IP PUBLICA>&port=<EL PUERTO>&secret=<EL SECRETO>\n```\n\nSi encuentras alg√∫n fallo, por favor, d√≠melo para que pueda actualizarlo.\n",

I was quite good at PE. I was one of the fastest of my classmates, and among them were several who used to compete. My mother will always regret not forcing me to enroll in the running team. So do I. But it is what it is. Maybe if I had, I would never have liked it. Who knows.</p>\n<p>But even with my natural predisposition to run, I managed to screw up things really badly.</p>\n<p>My first running plan for years was to go out for a max-effort run (I didn‚Äôt know you could run slower!) and then stop running for days or weeks to recover. My first ‚Äúserious‚Äù goal was to reach 5k in 30 minutes; for no reason, it sounded like a challenge to me. And it wasn&rsquo;t. I reached that point quite fast, in about 2 weeks of just running.

It was for me for years. And I see it in most of my acquaintances. We all go with good intentions. And that&rsquo;s great, but it doesn&rsquo;t work for most of us. Goals must be measurable. ‚ÄúI want to be fitted‚Äù is not quantifiable. You don‚Äôt know when it‚Äôs done, and you can&rsquo;t track the progression easily if you are a beginner like me. Also, a goal should be hard. You can have milestones along the path, but there should be at least one long-term goal to fight for. That was and is my intention every single day I train.</p>\n<p>And what is that goal? Well, a classic one: To run a marathon.</p>\n<p>Let me tell you that when I got the idea, it sounded feasible. Now it does too. I know I will make it sooner or later. But for a while, it felt like a stupid idea.</p>\n<p>What after the goal?, you might ask. I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe I don‚Äôt like the experience at all, and I decide to run shorter distances. Or maybe I want to do another activity. Who knows. But I am not there yet. And that&rsquo;s the point of the goal and the milestones. You need milestones along the road to stop thinking about the goal. To have small things to evaluate. You could say that improving pace, heart rate, or muscle gains are small things you can evaluate, but they feel cold. And you will have good and bad weeks. If, for a while, I run slower, or the heat makes my heart pound, it&rsquo;s not a problem. I have a milestone ahead: Finish the next race and, ideally, do it faster than before.</p>\n<p>So instead of making my own plan, because that was something that would never happen, I found a personal trainer who knows about running. That was in June 2022. We decided that there was no due date for the marathon or for any of the milestones. Working remotely is something that I truly enjoy, but I created really unhealthy habits, and when the lockdowns started, they didn‚Äôt improve at all. I was extremely out of shape, and I didn‚Äôt know this at that moment, but I was stressed and sleep-deprived.</p>\n<p>It took a few months to feel ready for a race. Or that was what we thought. I didn&rsquo;t know how to communicate my progression in the training. I was overweight‚Äî78 kg for a 173cm guy‚Äîand I overtrained without really knowing it. In fact, I didn&rsquo;t know you could overtrain at all.</p>\n<p>September 2022, a nightly 10k along the coast. Earlier in the week, I had a weird pain in my left leg around the internal part of the calf while attending a training session at the gym with my girlfriend.

But, hey, I finished it. 59:23.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I was not able to get rid of it for months. Then I raced again on December 31, 2022, a shorter distance. And the pain came back. I stopped running for the first half of 2023 to recover properly. It might look like a lot of time, but keep in mind that I wasn‚Äôt able to walk without pain for two months. I really screwed up my leg. I should have used this time to do strength training, but I didn‚Äôt. My trainer set a plan, but I was mentally exhausted, so I decided to call it and take a break. That was a mistake. Reasonable, but a mistake nonetheless.</p>\n<h2 id=\"summer-2023-i-started-running-again\">Summer 2023: I started running again.</h2>\n<p>I need to admit that up to this point, running was something I was doing because I thought it was good for me, but I wasn‚Äôt truly enjoying it. Then, one day, I ran 12km without any goal in mind at an easy pace on a nice rainy morning. And something clicked. I was alone, across a walking path, surrounded by mountains. I loved every second of it.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Suddenly, instead of running because I wanted to be fitter, I wanted to be fitter to feel something like that day. I wanted to be fitter to run.</p>\n<p>I slowly started to fix my sleep patterns (oh boy, there was a lot to fix here), I did blood tests (vitamin D was really low), and I took care of my eating habits. The classic stuff: tracking calories and protein, stopping drinking coffee around noon, going to bed earlier, quitting social media completely, and starting to read books on a daily basis. These two last things might not be really related to health, but somehow I can feel they changed my mental energy for the better.</p>\n<p>I started again with the trainer and added Pilates to the equation. 3 running sessions, 2 Pilates classes and 1 strength session per week.</p>\n<p>I moved from 78kg to 70kg in a few months.

I loved every second of it.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/123741/2024/photo-2024-03-18-11-10-02.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\">\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/123741/2024/photo-2024-03-18-11-10-15.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"1066\" alt=\"\">\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/123741/2024/photo-2024-03-18-11-10-20.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\">\n\nSuddenly, instead of running because I wanted to be fitter, I wanted to be fitter to feel something like that day. I wanted to be fitter to run.\n\nI slowly started to fix my sleep patterns (oh boy, there was a lot to fix here), I did blood tests (vitamin D was really low), and I took care of my eating habits. The classic stuff: tracking calories and protein, stopping drinking coffee around noon, going to bed earlier, quitting social media completely, and starting to read books on a daily basis. These two last things might not be really related to health, but somehow I can feel they changed my mental energy for the better.\n\nI started again with the trainer and added Pilates to the equation. 3 running sessions, 2 Pilates classes and 1 strength session per week.\n\nI moved from 78kg to 70kg in a few months. The scale freaked out. Abs are now a thing.\n\nRan several 5k and 10k. My best times are 23:20 for the 5k and 47:48 for the 10k. Nothing fancy; there is still a lot of work to do, but I didn't start to run because I wanted to win races. \n\nRunning is not a habit anymore. I made running a hobby, and I am looking for it every single week. I now organize my week around running.\n\nEnough with the melodramatic backstory; let‚Äôs train. See you in a week.\n\n",

Fedora 39 and Rawhide should have this version\r\nYou can check the release updates here:\r\n\r\n- [Fedora 37](https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2023-4bf641255e)\r\n- [Fedora 38](https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2023-fe53e13b5b)\r\n- [Fedora 39](https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2023-822aab0a5a)\r\n- [Fedora 40](https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2023-d4a817543f)\r\n\r\n## Other stuff\r\nContinue reading Dune and listening to The Hobbit while I do chores. I did enjoy The Hobbit back in the day, but I am enjoying the audio version even more. Dune, well, it is getting better (I am almost done with it), but nope, sorry, I think it is an excellent plot with awful writing.\r\n\r\nI thought I had recovered from COVID, but I had a 10k race this Sunday and felt it. I do not compete at all; I run for fun, and I think I did it quite nicely. My comparison is always my previous races, and in this case, I did it great. But... I felt the COVID effects and the lack of training over the last two weeks. That was not fun.\r\n\r\n## Next week\r\nI want to work on a POC to improve the workflow and coverage in the Go FIPS fork and, at the same time, write a blog post about it (which is a critical task I need to finish before next week) so... that will be my main focus.\r\nIf I have time for whatever reason (I don't think so), I'll start a small pet project I am excited about.\n",

I was aware of its relevance, but seeing it in first person is\nmind-blowing. This was my first time attending; it won&rsquo;t be the last.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-trip\">The trip</h2>\n<p>Traveling from the north of Spain to Brussels means a 7 hours trip, 5\nhours of flights in total with 2 hours waiting between flights. I&rsquo;m\nused to it at this point. Noise-canceling headphones and a book helped\ntremendously.</p>\n<p>I wasn&rsquo;t aware of the size of the event yet. While waiting in Madrid\nfor the second flight, I noticed that most people around me were also\nattending FOSDEM.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexsaezm/status/1621469610787721217\">Also, Ron Evans (@deadprogram) was on the same flight.</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"talks-and-events\">Talks and events</h2>\n<p>Before the event, several people told me that I should only aim to\nattend some of the talks. Mainly because it&rsquo;s impossible, the tracks\nhappen simultaneously, and meeting people in 3D is way more important.</p>\n<p>I attended most of the talks at the\n<a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/go/\">Go</a> and <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/binary_tools/\">Binary tools</a>\ndevrooms. Two of my teammates were speakers there.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/bintools_libabigail/\">Dodji&rsquo;s</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/godelve/\">Derek&rsquo;s</a>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexsaezm/status/1621840553204752385\">I think Derek passive-aggressive called me out for being late in a feature</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I also went to the Fedora contributor dinner with <a href=\"https://mikel.olasagasti.info/\">Mikel</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"meeting-new-people\">Meeting new people</h2>\n<p>This was the most important thing on the whole trip. And it&rsquo;s the\nsaddest part of my job. Even though I&rsquo;m not the most social animal in\nthe world, I like the people I work with. But we are a fully remote\nteam, and we couldn&rsquo;t meet for 2 years due to travel restrictions.

				"content_text": "\nI need to confess something. I was surprised to find out how big [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2023/)\nis. I was aware of its relevance, but seeing it in first person is\nmind-blowing. This was my first time attending; it won't be the last.\n\n## The trip\n\nTraveling from the north of Spain to Brussels means a 7 hours trip, 5\nhours of flights in total with 2 hours waiting between flights. I'm\nused to it at this point. Noise-canceling headphones and a book helped\ntremendously.\n\nI wasn't aware of the size of the event yet. While waiting in Madrid\nfor the second flight, I noticed that most people around me were also\nattending FOSDEM.\n\n[Also, Ron Evans (@deadprogram) was on the same flight.](https://twitter.com/alexsaezm/status/1621469610787721217)\n\n## Talks and events\n\nBefore the event, several people told me that I should only aim to\nattend some of the talks. Mainly because it's impossible, the tracks\nhappen simultaneously, and meeting people in 3D is way more important.\n\nI attended most of the talks at the\n[Go](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/go/) and [Binary tools](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/binary_tools/)\ndevrooms. Two of my teammates were speakers there.\n\n- [Dodji's](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/bintools_libabigail/)\n- [Derek's](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/godelve/)\n    > [I think Derek passive-aggressive called me out for being late in a feature](https://twitter.com/alexsaezm/status/1621840553204752385)\n\nI also went to the Fedora contributor dinner with [Mikel](https://mikel.olasagasti.info/).\n\n## Meeting new people\n\nThis was the most important thing on the whole trip. And it's the\nsaddest part of my job. Even though I'm not the most social animal in\nthe world, I like the people I work with. But we are a fully remote\nteam, and we couldn't meet for 2 years due to travel restrictions. When\nI joined almost 4 years ago, I attended my team's annual gathering.\nStill, several of the people I work with couldn't participate.\n\nI hung out with new people, but most of my beers were with those\nteammates.

A lot of projects\n> would have suffered **a lot**.\n\n## Reflections and conclusions\n\nWhat can I say? It was a great experience. A weekend abroad, too many\nbeers, and the opportunity to talk to awesome people. I can't wait for\nthe next event.\n\nAlso, why did I travel with a 15\\\" laptop?

These days, we have a wide variety of tools to help us create reproducible deployments. In this article, I will show you how easy it is to build a basic RPM package.</p>\n<p>We have had package managers for a while. <a href=\"https://rpm.org\">RPM</a> and <a href=\"http://yum.baseurl.org\">YUM</a> simplify installing, updating, or removing a piece of software. However, many companies use package managers only to install software from the operating system vendor and don‚Äôt use them for deployments. Creating a package can be daunting at first, but usually, it‚Äôs a rewarding exercise that can simplify your pipeline. As a test case, I will show you how to package a simple program written in <a href=\"https://go.dev\">Go</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"creating-the-package\">Creating the package</h2>\n<p>Many sites rely on configuration managers for deployment.

				"content_text": "\n> This post was originally published on Red Hat Developer. To read the original post, visit [Build your own RPM package with a sample Go program](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/05/21/build-your-own-rpm-package-sample-go-program).\n\nA deployment usually involves multiple steps that can be tricky. These days, we have a wide variety of tools to help us create reproducible deployments. In this article, I will show you how easy it is to build a basic RPM package.\n\nWe have had package managers for a while. [RPM](https://rpm.org) and [YUM](http://yum.baseurl.org) simplify installing, updating, or removing a piece of software. However, many companies use package managers only to install software from the operating system vendor and don‚Äôt use them for deployments. Creating a package can be daunting at first, but usually, it‚Äôs a rewarding exercise that can simplify your pipeline. As a test case, I will show you how to package a simple program written in [Go](https://go.dev).\n\n## Creating the package\n\nMany sites rely on configuration managers for deployment. For instance, a typical [Ansible](https://developers.redhat.com/products/ansible/overview) playbook might be:\n\n```yaml\n tasks:\n    - name: 'Copy the artifact'\n      copy:\n        src: 'my_app'\n        dest: '/usr/bin/my_app'\n      \n    - name: 'Copy configuration files'\n      template:\n        src: config.json\n        dest: /etc/my_app/config.json\n```\n\nOf course, a real-life playbook will include more steps, like checking the previous installation or handling services. But why not use something like this?\n\n```yaml\n  tasks:\n    - name: 'Install my_app'\n      yum:\n        name: 'my_app'\n```\n\nNow, let‚Äôs see our Go application that serves up a webpage. Here's the `main.go` file:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"encoding/json\"\n    \"flag\"\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"io/ioutil\"\n    \"log\"\n    \"net/http\"\n)\n\ntype config struct {\n    Text string `json:\"string\"`\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\n    var filename = flag.String(\"config\", \"config.json\", \"\")\n    flag.Parse()\n\n    data, err := ioutil.ReadFile(*filename)\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatalln(err)\n    }\n\n    var config config\n    err = json.Unmarshal(data, &config)\n\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatalln(err)\n    }\n\n    http.HandleFunc(\"/\", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n        fmt.Fprintf(w, config.Text)\n    })\n\n    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(\":8081\", nil))\n\n}\n```\n\nAnd our `config.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"string\": \"Hello world :)\"\n}\n```\n\nIf we run this program, we should see a web page with the config.json text in port 8081. It's far from production-ready, but it will serve as an example.\n\n## Adding services\n\nWhat about a service? Adding services is an excellent way to unify the management of an application, so let‚Äôs create our `my_app.service`:\n\n```bash\n[Unit]\nDescription=My App\n\n[Service]\nType=simple\nExecStart=/usr/bin/my_app -config /etc/my_app/config.json\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n```\n\nEvery time we want to deploy our application, we need to:\n\n1. Compile the project.\n2. Copy it to `/usr/bin/my_app`.\n3. Copy the `config.json` file to `/etc/my_app/config.json`.\n4. Copy `my_app.service` to `/etc/systemd/system/`.\n5. Start the service.\n\n## Creating the spec file\n\nLike Ansible, an RPM package needs a definition file where we specify the installation steps, the dependencies, and other things that we might need to install our application on a server:\n\n```bash\n$ sudo dnf install git\n$ sudo dnf module install go-toolset\n$ sudo dnf groupinstall \"RPM Development Tools\"\n```\n\nWith all of this installed, we are ready to create the package definition file, also known as the spec file:\n\n```bash\n$ rpmdev-newspec my_app.spec\n```\n\nA spec file can be tricky, but we will keep this simple to appreciate the power of the tool:\n\n```yaml\nName:           my_app\nVersion:        1.0\nRelease:        1%{?dist}\nSummary:        A simple web app\n\nLicense:        GPLv3\nSource0:        %{name}-%{version}.tar.gz\n\nBuildRequires:  golang\nBuildRequires:  systemd-rpm-macros\n\nProvides:       %{name} = %{version}\n\n%description\nA simple web app\n\n%global debug_package %{nil}\n\n%prep\n%autosetup\n\n\n%build\ngo build -v -o %{name}\n\n\n%install\ninstall -Dpm 0755 %{name} %{buildroot}%{_bindir}/%{name}\ninstall -Dpm 0755 config.json %{buildroot}%{_sysconfdir}/%{name}/config.json\ninstall -Dpm 644 %{name}.service %{buildroot}%{_unitdir}/%{name}.service\n\n%check\n# go test should be here... :)\n\n%post\n%systemd_post %{name}.service\n\n%preun\n%systemd_preun %{name}.service\n\n%files\n%dir %{_sysconfdir}/%{name}\n%{_bindir}/%{name}\n%{_unitdir}/%{name}.service\n%config(noreplace) %{_sysconfdir}/%{name}/config.json\n\n\n%changelog\n* Wed May 19 2021 John Doe - 1.0-1\n- First release%changelog\n```\n\nA few notes:\n\n* The `Source0` entry can be the source code repository, something like this: `https://github.com/user/my_app/archive/v%version.tar.gz`.\n* If you use a URL in `Source0`, you can issue `spectool -g my_app.spec` to download your source code.\n* Git allows you to quickly set up a tarball without creating a remote repository:\n\n```bash\n$ git archive --format=tar.gz --prefix=my_app-1.0/ -o my_app-1.0.tar.gz HEAD\n```\n\n* The tarball content should look like this:\n\n```bash\n$ tar tf my_app-1.0.tar.gz \nmy_app-1.0/\nmy_app-1.0/config.json\nmy_app-1.0/main.go\nmy_app-1.0/my_app.service\n```\n\n## Building the RPM\n\nFirst, we need to create the rpmbuild structure and place our tarball inside the source's directory:\n\n```bash\n$ rpmdev-setuptree\n$ mv my_app-1.0.tar.gz ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES\n```\n\nNow, let‚Äôs build the RPM for [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel/overview) 8:\n\n```bash\n$ rpmbuild -ba my_app.spec\n```\n\nAnd that's it!\n\nYou should be able to install the RPM now and start the service:\n\n```bash\n$ sudo dnf install ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/my_app-1.0-1.el8.x86_64.rpm\n$ sudo systemctl start my_app\n$ curl -L http://localhost:8081\n```\n\nYou should see the content of our `config.json` (which, by the way, is under `/etc/my_app`).\n\nBut what if we have a new version of our application? We only need to increase the spec file version and build it again. DNF will see that there is a new update available.\n\nAnd if you are using a package repository, you only need to run `dnf update my_app`.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf you want to delve more into the idea of incorporating RPM files in your deployments, I suggest looking at the [RPM Packaging Guide](https://rpm-packaging-guide.github.io) and the [Fedora Packaging Guidelines](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines).\n\nAlso, a variety of exciting tools are available to help with the build process or even create repositories for you to use, such as [mock](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/mock), [fedpkg](https://pagure.io/fedpkg), [COPR](https://pagure.io/copr/copr), and [Koji](https://pagure.io/koji/). These tools can help you in complex scenarios with multiple dependencies, complex steps, or multiple architectures.\n\nNote that the workflow demonstrated in this article is also applicable to Fedora and to CentOS Stream.\n",

The answer is simple, at least for me: complex things take a lot of time and are error-prone. Simple stuff where you can&rsquo;t delve more is easy to read and easy to retweet.

Shame on me.\n\n## The release\n\nFirst of all, let's check what is included in Go `1.15.12` by looking at\nthe [upstream milestone](https://github.com/golang/go/milestone/209?closed=1).\nAt some point in the release process, we'll need to specify if we solve something\nwith this release already tracked in the Fedora bug tracker.\n\n*/me looks bugs and reads comments...*\n\nAlright! It looks like we only have [issue 45711](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/45711) which seems to be [bug 1958343](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1958343).\n\nWell, I guess we can start the release process:\n\n```bash\n# Clone the fedora repository\nfedpkg clone golang && cd golang\n# Switch to the target release\nfedpkg switch-branch f33\n# Bump up the version\nrpmdev-bumpspec golang.spec\n# 99.999% of the time we'll need to edit the golang.spec\nvim golang.spec\n# Let's download the upstream sources\nspectool -g golang.spec\n# Include them in the Fedora cache\nfedpkg new-sources go1.15.12.src.tar.gz\n# Commit the changes\ngit add -A && git commit -m \"Update to go1.15.12\"\n# Perform a scratch build before submiting the code\nfedpkg scratch-build --srpm\n# Wait...\ngit push\n# The real build\nfedpkg build\n# After a while we can do the release with the information of the bug\nfedpkg update\n```\n\nA quick summary of what we have:\n\n- [The commit](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/golang/c/b2a8f76814f5c9246873fd78cd2c6c32fa110605?branch=f33)\n- [The scratch build](https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=67614415)\n- [The build](https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=67617917)\n- [The release](https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2021-a50122f73b)\n\n## The testing\n\nNow that our release is on testing, we can create a container, subscribe to\nthat testing channel, and see if I screwed it again :). And this is an excellent\nexcuse to use Toolbox.\n\n```bash\ntoolbox create --release 33 \ntoolbox enter --container fedora-toolbox-33\n```\n\nNow we should be inside a container. A nice thing about Toolbox is that we don't have\nany of the packages installed on the host, just those that came with the image.\nStill, we have access to all of our configurations and files. Pretty neat to test stuff, isn't it?\n\nWe can install Go, check the version, and then, once the package we submitted reaches the\ntesting state, update it by using the updates-testing repository:\n\n```bash\n# First we need the stable package\nsudo yum install golang\n# Output: go version go1.15.11 linux/amd64\ngo version\n# The magic trick\nsudo dnf upgrade --enablerepo=updates-testing golang\n# Output: go version go1.15.12 linux/amd64\ngo version\n```\n\n> If you use VSCode, you can now jump into the container using `Attach to Running Container`.\n\nIf you are interested in helping out the Fedora community, [feel free to read the wiki](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:Updates_Testing),\nand if you don't have spare machines to try new and potentially unstable stuff, you can use this container approach with a lot of different packages\n(forget about kernel testing for example) or swap the container for a VM.\n\nHappy testing :)\n",
