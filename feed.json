Fedora 39 and Rawhide should have this version\r\nYou can check the release updates here:\r\n\r\n- [Fedora 37](https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2023-4bf641255e)\r\n- [Fedora 38](https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2023-fe53e13b5b)\r\n- [Fedora 39](https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2023-822aab0a5a)\r\n- [Fedora 40](https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2023-d4a817543f)\r\n\r\n## Other stuff\r\nContinue reading Dune and listening to The Hobbit while I do chores. I did enjoy The Hobbit back in the day, but I am enjoying the audio version even more. Dune, well, it is getting better (I am almost done with it), but nope, sorry, I think it is an excellent plot with awful writing.\r\n\r\nI thought I had recovered from COVID, but I had a 10k race this Sunday and felt it. I do not compete at all; I run for fun, and I think I did it quite nicely. My comparison is always my previous races, and in this case, I did it great. But... I felt the COVID effects and the lack of training over the last two weeks. That was not fun.\r\n\r\n## Next week\r\nI want to work on a POC to improve the workflow and coverage in the Go FIPS fork and, at the same time, write a blog post about it (which is a critical task I need to finish before next week) so... that will be my main focus.\r\nIf I have time for whatever reason (I don't think so), I'll start a small pet project I am excited about.\n",

I was aware of its relevance, but seeing it in first person is\nmind-blowing. This was my first time attending; it won&rsquo;t be the last.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-trip\">The trip</h2>\n<p>Traveling from the north of Spain to Brussels means a 7 hours trip, 5\nhours of flights in total with 2 hours waiting between flights. I&rsquo;m\nused to it at this point. Noise-canceling headphones and a book helped\ntremendously.</p>\n<p>I wasn&rsquo;t aware of the size of the event yet. While waiting in Madrid\nfor the second flight, I noticed that most people around me were also\nattending FOSDEM.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexsaezm/status/1621469610787721217\">Also, Ron Evans (@deadprogram) was on the same flight.</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"talks-and-events\">Talks and events</h2>\n<p>Before the event, several people told me that I should only aim to\nattend some of the talks. Mainly because it&rsquo;s impossible, the tracks\nhappen simultaneously, and meeting people in 3D is way more important.</p>\n<p>I attended most of the talks at the\n<a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/go/\">Go</a> and <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/binary_tools/\">Binary tools</a>\ndevrooms. Two of my teammates were speakers there.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/bintools_libabigail/\">Dodji&rsquo;s</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/godelve/\">Derek&rsquo;s</a>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexsaezm/status/1621840553204752385\">I think Derek passive-aggressive called me out for being late in a feature</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I also went to the Fedora contributor dinner with <a href=\"https://mikel.olasagasti.info/\">Mikel</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"meeting-new-people\">Meeting new people</h2>\n<p>This was the most important thing on the whole trip. And it&rsquo;s the\nsaddest part of my job. Even though I&rsquo;m not the most social animal in\nthe world, I like the people I work with. But we are a fully remote\nteam, and we couldn&rsquo;t meet for 2 years due to travel restrictions.

				"content_text": "\nI need to confess something. I was surprised to find out how big [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2023/)\nis. I was aware of its relevance, but seeing it in first person is\nmind-blowing. This was my first time attending; it won't be the last.\n\n## The trip\n\nTraveling from the north of Spain to Brussels means a 7 hours trip, 5\nhours of flights in total with 2 hours waiting between flights. I'm\nused to it at this point. Noise-canceling headphones and a book helped\ntremendously.\n\nI wasn't aware of the size of the event yet. While waiting in Madrid\nfor the second flight, I noticed that most people around me were also\nattending FOSDEM.\n\n[Also, Ron Evans (@deadprogram) was on the same flight.](https://twitter.com/alexsaezm/status/1621469610787721217)\n\n## Talks and events\n\nBefore the event, several people told me that I should only aim to\nattend some of the talks. Mainly because it's impossible, the tracks\nhappen simultaneously, and meeting people in 3D is way more important.\n\nI attended most of the talks at the\n[Go](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/go/) and [Binary tools](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/binary_tools/)\ndevrooms. Two of my teammates were speakers there.\n\n- [Dodji's](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/bintools_libabigail/)\n- [Derek's](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/godelve/)\n    > [I think Derek passive-aggressive called me out for being late in a feature](https://twitter.com/alexsaezm/status/1621840553204752385)\n\nI also went to the Fedora contributor dinner with [Mikel](https://mikel.olasagasti.info/).\n\n## Meeting new people\n\nThis was the most important thing on the whole trip. And it's the\nsaddest part of my job. Even though I'm not the most social animal in\nthe world, I like the people I work with. But we are a fully remote\nteam, and we couldn't meet for 2 years due to travel restrictions. When\nI joined almost 4 years ago, I attended my team's annual gathering.\nStill, several of the people I work with couldn't participate.\n\nI hung out with new people, but most of my beers were with those\nteammates.

A lot of projects\n> would have suffered **a lot**.\n\n## Reflections and conclusions\n\nWhat can I say? It was a great experience. A weekend abroad, too many\nbeers, and the opportunity to talk to awesome people. I can't wait for\nthe next event.\n\nAlso, why did I travel with a 15\\\" laptop?

These days, we have a wide variety of tools to help us create reproducible deployments. In this article, I will show you how easy it is to build a basic RPM package.</p>\n<p>We have had package managers for a while. <a href=\"https://rpm.org\">RPM</a> and <a href=\"http://yum.baseurl.org\">YUM</a> simplify installing, updating, or removing a piece of software. However, many companies use package managers only to install software from the operating system vendor and don‚Äôt use them for deployments. Creating a package can be daunting at first, but usually, it‚Äôs a rewarding exercise that can simplify your pipeline. As a test case, I will show you how to package a simple program written in <a href=\"https://go.dev\">Go</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"creating-the-package\">Creating the package</h2>\n<p>Many sites rely on configuration managers for deployment.

				"content_text": "\n> This post was originally published on Red Hat Developer. To read the original post, visit [Build your own RPM package with a sample Go program](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/05/21/build-your-own-rpm-package-sample-go-program).\n\nA deployment usually involves multiple steps that can be tricky. These days, we have a wide variety of tools to help us create reproducible deployments. In this article, I will show you how easy it is to build a basic RPM package.\n\nWe have had package managers for a while. [RPM](https://rpm.org) and [YUM](http://yum.baseurl.org) simplify installing, updating, or removing a piece of software. However, many companies use package managers only to install software from the operating system vendor and don‚Äôt use them for deployments. Creating a package can be daunting at first, but usually, it‚Äôs a rewarding exercise that can simplify your pipeline. As a test case, I will show you how to package a simple program written in [Go](https://go.dev).\n\n## Creating the package\n\nMany sites rely on configuration managers for deployment. For instance, a typical [Ansible](https://developers.redhat.com/products/ansible/overview) playbook might be:\n\n```yaml\n tasks:\n    - name: 'Copy the artifact'\n      copy:\n        src: 'my_app'\n        dest: '/usr/bin/my_app'\n      \n    - name: 'Copy configuration files'\n      template:\n        src: config.json\n        dest: /etc/my_app/config.json\n```\n\nOf course, a real-life playbook will include more steps, like checking the previous installation or handling services. But why not use something like this?\n\n```yaml\n  tasks:\n    - name: 'Install my_app'\n      yum:\n        name: 'my_app'\n```\n\nNow, let‚Äôs see our Go application that serves up a webpage. Here's the `main.go` file:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"encoding/json\"\n    \"flag\"\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"io/ioutil\"\n    \"log\"\n    \"net/http\"\n)\n\ntype config struct {\n    Text string `json:\"string\"`\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\n    var filename = flag.String(\"config\", \"config.json\", \"\")\n    flag.Parse()\n\n    data, err := ioutil.ReadFile(*filename)\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatalln(err)\n    }\n\n    var config config\n    err = json.Unmarshal(data, &config)\n\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatalln(err)\n    }\n\n    http.HandleFunc(\"/\", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n        fmt.Fprintf(w, config.Text)\n    })\n\n    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(\":8081\", nil))\n\n}\n```\n\nAnd our `config.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"string\": \"Hello world :)\"\n}\n```\n\nIf we run this program, we should see a web page with the config.json text in port 8081. It's far from production-ready, but it will serve as an example.\n\n## Adding services\n\nWhat about a service? Adding services is an excellent way to unify the management of an application, so let‚Äôs create our `my_app.service`:\n\n```bash\n[Unit]\nDescription=My App\n\n[Service]\nType=simple\nExecStart=/usr/bin/my_app -config /etc/my_app/config.json\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n```\n\nEvery time we want to deploy our application, we need to:\n\n1. Compile the project.\n2. Copy it to `/usr/bin/my_app`.\n3. Copy the `config.json` file to `/etc/my_app/config.json`.\n4. Copy `my_app.service` to `/etc/systemd/system/`.\n5. Start the service.\n\n## Creating the spec file\n\nLike Ansible, an RPM package needs a definition file where we specify the installation steps, the dependencies, and other things that we might need to install our application on a server:\n\n```bash\n$ sudo dnf install git\n$ sudo dnf module install go-toolset\n$ sudo dnf groupinstall \"RPM Development Tools\"\n```\n\nWith all of this installed, we are ready to create the package definition file, also known as the spec file:\n\n```bash\n$ rpmdev-newspec my_app.spec\n```\n\nA spec file can be tricky, but we will keep this simple to appreciate the power of the tool:\n\n```yaml\nName:           my_app\nVersion:        1.0\nRelease:        1%{?dist}\nSummary:        A simple web app\n\nLicense:        GPLv3\nSource0:        %{name}-%{version}.tar.gz\n\nBuildRequires:  golang\nBuildRequires:  systemd-rpm-macros\n\nProvides:       %{name} = %{version}\n\n%description\nA simple web app\n\n%global debug_package %{nil}\n\n%prep\n%autosetup\n\n\n%build\ngo build -v -o %{name}\n\n\n%install\ninstall -Dpm 0755 %{name} %{buildroot}%{_bindir}/%{name}\ninstall -Dpm 0755 config.json %{buildroot}%{_sysconfdir}/%{name}/config.json\ninstall -Dpm 644 %{name}.service %{buildroot}%{_unitdir}/%{name}.service\n\n%check\n# go test should be here... :)\n\n%post\n%systemd_post %{name}.service\n\n%preun\n%systemd_preun %{name}.service\n\n%files\n%dir %{_sysconfdir}/%{name}\n%{_bindir}/%{name}\n%{_unitdir}/%{name}.service\n%config(noreplace) %{_sysconfdir}/%{name}/config.json\n\n\n%changelog\n* Wed May 19 2021 John Doe - 1.0-1\n- First release%changelog\n```\n\nA few notes:\n\n* The `Source0` entry can be the source code repository, something like this: `https://github.com/user/my_app/archive/v%version.tar.gz`.\n* If you use a URL in `Source0`, you can issue `spectool -g my_app.spec` to download your source code.\n* Git allows you to quickly set up a tarball without creating a remote repository:\n\n```bash\n$ git archive --format=tar.gz --prefix=my_app-1.0/ -o my_app-1.0.tar.gz HEAD\n```\n\n* The tarball content should look like this:\n\n```bash\n$ tar tf my_app-1.0.tar.gz \nmy_app-1.0/\nmy_app-1.0/config.json\nmy_app-1.0/main.go\nmy_app-1.0/my_app.service\n```\n\n## Building the RPM\n\nFirst, we need to create the rpmbuild structure and place our tarball inside the source's directory:\n\n```bash\n$ rpmdev-setuptree\n$ mv my_app-1.0.tar.gz ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES\n```\n\nNow, let‚Äôs build the RPM for [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel/overview) 8:\n\n```bash\n$ rpmbuild -ba my_app.spec\n```\n\nAnd that's it!\n\nYou should be able to install the RPM now and start the service:\n\n```bash\n$ sudo dnf install ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/my_app-1.0-1.el8.x86_64.rpm\n$ sudo systemctl start my_app\n$ curl -L http://localhost:8081\n```\n\nYou should see the content of our `config.json` (which, by the way, is under `/etc/my_app`).\n\nBut what if we have a new version of our application? We only need to increase the spec file version and build it again. DNF will see that there is a new update available.\n\nAnd if you are using a package repository, you only need to run `dnf update my_app`.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf you want to delve more into the idea of incorporating RPM files in your deployments, I suggest looking at the [RPM Packaging Guide](https://rpm-packaging-guide.github.io) and the [Fedora Packaging Guidelines](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines).\n\nAlso, a variety of exciting tools are available to help with the build process or even create repositories for you to use, such as [mock](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/mock), [fedpkg](https://pagure.io/fedpkg), [COPR](https://pagure.io/copr/copr), and [Koji](https://pagure.io/koji/). These tools can help you in complex scenarios with multiple dependencies, complex steps, or multiple architectures.\n\nNote that the workflow demonstrated in this article is also applicable to Fedora and to CentOS Stream.\n",

The answer is simple, at least for me: complex things take a lot of time and are error-prone. Simple stuff where you can&rsquo;t delve more is easy to read and easy to retweet.

Shame on me.\n\n## The release\n\nFirst of all, let's check what is included in Go `1.15.12` by looking at\nthe [upstream milestone](https://github.com/golang/go/milestone/209?closed=1).\nAt some point in the release process, we'll need to specify if we solve something\nwith this release already tracked in the Fedora bug tracker.\n\n*/me looks bugs and reads comments...*\n\nAlright! It looks like we only have [issue 45711](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/45711) which seems to be [bug 1958343](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1958343).\n\nWell, I guess we can start the release process:\n\n```bash\n# Clone the fedora repository\nfedpkg clone golang && cd golang\n# Switch to the target release\nfedpkg switch-branch f33\n# Bump up the version\nrpmdev-bumpspec golang.spec\n# 99.999% of the time we'll need to edit the golang.spec\nvim golang.spec\n# Let's download the upstream sources\nspectool -g golang.spec\n# Include them in the Fedora cache\nfedpkg new-sources go1.15.12.src.tar.gz\n# Commit the changes\ngit add -A && git commit -m \"Update to go1.15.12\"\n# Perform a scratch build before submiting the code\nfedpkg scratch-build --srpm\n# Wait...\ngit push\n# The real build\nfedpkg build\n# After a while we can do the release with the information of the bug\nfedpkg update\n```\n\nA quick summary of what we have:\n\n- [The commit](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/golang/c/b2a8f76814f5c9246873fd78cd2c6c32fa110605?branch=f33)\n- [The scratch build](https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=67614415)\n- [The build](https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=67617917)\n- [The release](https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2021-a50122f73b)\n\n## The testing\n\nNow that our release is on testing, we can create a container, subscribe to\nthat testing channel, and see if I screwed it again :). And this is an excellent\nexcuse to use Toolbox.\n\n```bash\ntoolbox create --release 33 \ntoolbox enter --container fedora-toolbox-33\n```\n\nNow we should be inside a container. A nice thing about Toolbox is that we don't have\nany of the packages installed on the host, just those that came with the image.\nStill, we have access to all of our configurations and files. Pretty neat to test stuff, isn't it?\n\nWe can install Go, check the version, and then, once the package we submitted reaches the\ntesting state, update it by using the updates-testing repository:\n\n```bash\n# First we need the stable package\nsudo yum install golang\n# Output: go version go1.15.11 linux/amd64\ngo version\n# The magic trick\nsudo dnf upgrade --enablerepo=updates-testing golang\n# Output: go version go1.15.12 linux/amd64\ngo version\n```\n\n> If you use VSCode, you can now jump into the container using `Attach to Running Container`.\n\nIf you are interested in helping out the Fedora community, [feel free to read the wiki](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:Updates_Testing),\nand if you don't have spare machines to try new and potentially unstable stuff, you can use this container approach with a lot of different packages\n(forget about kernel testing for example) or swap the container for a VM.\n\nHappy testing :)\n",
